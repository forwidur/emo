It is owing to the reason that technological advancement has an unpredictable impact on the political and social aspects of life.\\r\\nConsidering the current social outlook of UAE specially and the world in general, it is essential to prepare the children for future in a comprehensive manner. For this, the educational institutions have to play a significant role in nurturing the following behavior among all students without any discrimination.\\r\\nFor this, many schools systems are operating in the nuke and corner of the world bringing the best to the children concerning academics and personal grooming. However, the majority of parents prefer to send their children to the\\r\\nbest British schools in Dubai\\r\\nowing to the effectiveness of curriculum and quality of education.\\r\\nThe International School Consultancy (ISC Research) reveals\\r\\nthat around 8000 plus English medium schools are catering the educational requirements of the approximately four and a half million students across the world.\\r\\nSurprisingly, out of these eight thousand additional schools, around 3700 are British curriculum schools. It means that the majority of schools are either operating on the orientation of British national or offering UK curriculum to ensure quality education.\\r\\nLet’s consider the facts which make the UK curriculum-based educational institutions the best choice for your children:\\r\\nThe National Curriculum of England is comprehensively designed to ensure universal education for all. It does not mean that it has ignored the local aspirations of the people. So, additional amendments are done, and activities are incorporated for the requirements of the locality where the school is operating.\\r\\nThe curriculum is well-known for its holistic approach toward personal development. It is because the learning content is devised to fulfill the cognitive requirements of the students. So, it offers the students with balanced knowledge based on questioning, inquiry, problem-solving in a real-world scenario.\\r\\nThe primary reason for selecting the best British schools in Dubai is that the curriculum is justly divided into an established series of goals and objectives. These goals are achieved at every education levels.\\r\\nFor instance, the foundation stage caters the students from age 3–5 by offering them the best education. Further, the primary level is for the students of age 5–11 while the secondary level education is for the students belong to the age of 11–18. Lastly, the education may further lead to the qualification for A Level. Education is imparted in a balanced manner throughout all the stages. The learning material is connected vertically and horizontally to ensure comprehensiveness.\\r\\nTo sum up, the\\r\\nBritish education system\\r\\nhas obtained global reputation owing to quality and comprehensiveness. It is the reason that the best British schools are striving hard to maintain the unique status among other school systems operating in Dubai.\\r\\nRemember! Don’t make the selection of the school for your children merely based on content but consider the environment and co-curriculum activities also. It will help your children to get intellectual and analytical development comprehensively.',\n",

Now I am going to share how we did this and what was the experience.\\r\\nOur goal was to aware as many students as possible about the AMAL fellowship, so they can prepare themselves for their professional careers. So we decided to achieve our goal by visiting different universities, by arranging seminars, by social media, by networking etc.\\r\\nWe face some challenges during our mega project like we need to aware a lot of students for which we just had 15 days and we had to manage our Project Work, our university work as well as our mega project. So it was tough but we managed our time. There were some other challenges like asking for permission for seminars, arranging appointments etc but we managed our work with the help of team work and time management which we learned during AMAL fellowship.\\r\\nSo after visiting some universities we realized that students are showing interest and they were enthusiastic about this fellowship so we decided to arrange some seminars, so that, many students can get awareness of AMAL fellowship and it will be very useful for them.\\r\\nIt was a great experience, it really helped us to learn a lot. With the help of our mega project we made other students realize, what challenges they are going to face after graduation and how they can survive by doing AMAL fellowship. Overall it was a great experience and we learned a lot of things.\\r\\nWe are going to arrange one or two seminars in the coming week. Due to shortage of time we are able to arrange one or two seminars but we will try to aware as many students or other people who are doing jobs and want to perform well in there jobs as possible. Hopefully we will try our best to continue this project in future.\\r\\nIn the end I really want to thanks AMAL for giving us this wonderful opportunity.',\n",

       "  'body': 'My Grandma’s Fight With Ovarian Cancer Is Saving My Life.\\r\\n25th August 2017 just as I was having a glass of wine at Birmingham Airport and waiting to board my flight to Dar Es Salaam, I received a phone call that left my heart in pieces, my grandma had been diagnosed with Stage 3 Ovarian Cancer. I remember busting into tears and thinking, I’m meant to be flying back home for my niece’s dedication (god-mother duties called) and full of excitement but this moment was now replaced with tears and asking the universe 21 questions throughout the journey.\\r\\nIt had only been 5 years since my late mother was diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer, a disease she fought hard but eventually lost the battle to. I prayed that I don’t live to see another loved one battle Cancer, but here I was about to relive the experience of watching another loved one battle the “C” word and it had to be Ovarian Cancer AGAIN! Seeing my grandma when I got to Dar was a relief, she was full of faith and ready to give cancer a good fight with all the energy she had. My grandma is someone who believes in finding good and staying positive in the midst of storms. Mary Komba happens to be one of the strongest human I know.\\r\\nMonths afterwards were spent researching on Cancer and genetics, at this point I had to face the bitter truth, ‘Ovarian Cancer runs on my maternal family’. Cancer is not usually inherited but some types – mainly breast, ovarian and prostate cancer can be strongly influenced by genes and can run in families, for those who like me come from a family with history of either breast or ovarian cancer, a BRCA (blood) test is usually done to determine if you are a carrier of a faulty BRCA1 or BRCA 2 gene. Having a faulty BRCA gene can significantly raise your risk of developing both breast & ovarian cancer, with women with the faulty\\r\\nBRCA1 gene having a 60 to 90% lifetime risk of breast cancer and a 40 to 60% risk of ovarian cancer. In other words, out of every 100 women with the faulty BRCA1 gene between 60 and 90 will develop breast cancer in their lifetime and between 40 and 60 will develop ovarian cancer.\\r\\nOvarian Cancer is known as a “silent killer” for a reason, while science tells us it’s most common in women over 50 – it still affects younger women, with it’s symptoms often misdiagnosed for other conditions such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and has the lowest survival rate out of all gynaecological cancers. If you experience symptoms such as persistent bloating, back pain or stomach pain you should make an appointment to see your GP as soon as possible, to find out more about ovarian cancer symptoms, visit\\r\\nwww.ovarian.org.uk\\r\\n“Ovarian Cancer strikes the heart of what it means to be a woman”\\r\\n— Marie Claire Platt, Ovarian Cancer Action\\r\\nDear ladies, educate yourself on your family’s history on hereditary cancers and learn to listen to your body (be persistent with your doctor when you think something is wrong, cause 8 out 10 something will definitely be wrong). Being aware of your history and knowing the symptoms at an early stage can help you to take the necessary precautions to manage your risk and reduce the stress of the unknown including the possibility of passing on a faulty BRCA gene to your kids.\\r\\n“BRCA gene testing is also known as a predictive genetic testing because whilst a positive result means you have an increased risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer, it doesn’t mean you have cancer or are definitely going to develop it”.\\r\\nAfter being referred to the Clinical Genetics team, discussions on what the test meant, and options I had should I test positive followed; some of the options include (1) Surgery to remove my ovaries in order to eliminate my chances of developing ovarian cancer (2) Keep my ovaries and remove them once I have kids (3) Keep my ovaries and live with the risk of knowing I may or may not develop cancer later including some lifestyle changes to help lower my risk. Being in my mid-20’s the thought of having my ovaries removed now didn’t make sense and nights were spent kneeling before God and trying to think positive of what was ahead. Part 1 of the test came, ovaries scanned and praise the Most High my results came back good, it was a relief to be told I had healthy ovaries (future baby daddy we good), now it was time to sit and wait for Part 2 – the grand finale of getting my blood taken to determine if I’m a BRCA carrier.\\r\\nThe decision to go for a genetics testing was not an easy decision to make however for someone who is always trying to raise awareness about ovarian cancer, I had to practice what I preach. Whilst I’m waiting to go for the final test, I’m grateful to the heavens for the good results I’ve had so far and determined to remain positive until the end, above all I’m grateful to live in a country that gives me access to various cancer prevention tools which is often not the the case for some women due to various reasons i.e. living in a country with limited genetics testing resources or the financial burden if you are not eligible to have a BRCA test done under the NHS.\\r\\nMy grandma’s fight with Ovarian Cancer is saving my life and regardless of what my BRCA status turns out to be, I know I will be able to go to bed and sleep at night knowing it may have been a tough decision to make at such a young age but it is the best life decision I have made so far, and my future-self will thank me. Both, my mother’s and grandma’s fight with ovarian cancer have taught me about the importance of listening to your body and living with the truth is better than living with fear of the unknown. I dream of a future, where no woman dies of ovarian cancer and I hope more women particularly young women with family histories like mine, will take the necessary precautions.\\r\\nIn the words of Angelina Jolie “\\r\\nMy kids will never have to say mom died of Ovarian Cancer\\r\\n”.\\r\\nTo find out if your family history puts you at a higher risk of ovarian cancer, use the Hereditary Cancer Risk Tool via\\r\\nwww.ovarian.org.uk\\r\\nor for more information about the BRCA Gene, visit\\r\\nwww.ovarian.org.uk\\r\\n.',\n",

       "  'body': 'California Governor Jerry Brown has signed a cybersecurity law covering “smart” devices, making California the first state with such a law. The bill,\\r\\nSB-327\\r\\n, was introduced last year and passed the state Senate in late August.\\r\\nStarting on January 1st, 2020, any manufacturer of a device that connects “directly or indirectly” to the internet must equip it with “reasonable” security features, designed to prevent unauthorized access, modification, or information disclosure. If it can be accessed outside a local area network with a password, it needs to either come with a unique password for each device or force users to set their own password the first time they connect. That means no more generic default credentials for a hacker to guess.\\r\\nThe bill has been praised as a good first step by some and criticized by others for its vagueness.\\r\\nCybersecurity expert Robert Graham has been\\r\\none of its harshest critics. He’s argued that it gets security issues backward by focusing on adding “good” features instead of removing bad ones that open devices up to attacks. He praised the password requirement but said it doesn’t cover the whole range of authentication systems that “may or may not be called passwords,” which could still let manufacturers leave the kind of security holes that allowed the devastating Mirai botnet to spread in 2016.\\r\\nBut others, including Harvard University fellow Bruce Schneier, have said that it’s a good start. “It probably doesn’t go far enough\\u200a—\\u200abut that’s no reason not to pass it,” he\\r\\ntold\\r\\nThe Washington Post\\r\\n. While the rule is only state-wide, any device-makers who sell products in California would pass the benefits on to customers elsewhere.\\r\\nSeveral Internet of Things-related bills have been introduced in Congress, but none have made it to a vote. The\\r\\nIoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2017\\r\\nwould set minimum security standards for connected devices purchased by the government, but not electronics in general. Taking a separate track, the\\r\\nIoT Consumer TIPS Act of 2017\\r\\nwould direct the Federal Trade Commission to develop educational resources for consumers around connected devices, and the\\r\\nSMART IoT Act\\r\\nwould require the Department of Commerce to conduct a study on the state of the industry.',\n",

We have experienced a diverse growth in several areas of life, but education seems to have been left untouched. And that cannot be a good thing,\\r\\nright?\\r\\nEducational systems around the globe have focused on lecturing for hours during a day where students get to sit and supposedly absorb. But if we look at statistics and what people have been looking for today when it comes to education, one can only assume, we are on the wrong side of the track. Let´s look at all the online learning websites, and how this has become a phenomenon. Classes are short and clear, students get to study at their best time instead of a set time, and are more concerned about acquiring a skill then academic certifications.\\r\\nPeople are sending out a message about how they would like to learn.\\r\\nThere is such a diversity of people in a group of 20, 30 or even 40 people in one classroom, will they all learn the same way? Will only one way of teaching be able to reach them all efficiently?\\r\\nFrom every aspect we analyze the educational systems around the world, it seems far off, in other words, it is primitive in fulfilling our needs in the modern world.\\r\\nWith the birth of blockchain, new systems are being created transforming education and eventually in a near future what we have today as a nationalistic system will soon become a global system. And it is already happening.\\r\\nHere are 5 ways the blockchain technology will transform education:\\r\\n1. Online Credentials and Certifications on the Blockchain.\\r\\n2. Global Education\\u200a—\\u200aIt will facilitate long distance degrees, and expats.\\r\\n3. Cut down in Costs and allow for cryptocurrency payments.\\r\\n4. Massive Paper replacement.\\r\\n5. Free Education & an Increase in Students.\\r\\nPeople want to go to school, people want to acquire education but the costs in every aspect are reserved for the rich and fortunate.\\r\\nIn today´s system trying to acquire even something as simple as a copy of a transcript is a difficult process, imagine credentials, certifications, and transfers?\\r\\nToday trying to get transcripts, credentials, credits, grades from one country to another will pretty much make you want to quit going to school.\\r\\nSad but true.\\r\\nThe bureaucracy between the two schools in different countries is total nonsense; I know it because that is somewhat what I am going through at the moment, total frustration.\\r\\nNow had my transcripts, records, attendance, credits, had it all been on a blockchain it would be a painless process. Even If I wanted to get a degree in another country from whatever part of the world, it would be a fast, trustable, secure, and cheaper process.\\r\\nThe blockchain technology is revolutionizing how we see the modern school day system standards, and it´s making us ask ourselves “why are we doing things this way?”\\r\\nI came across a project called\\r\\nOpen Education Consortium\\r\\nthat simply fascinated me, and led me to one question: why is it we pay so much money for education?\\r\\nOEC promotes, supports and advance openness in education world for FREE.\\r\\nHigher education should be every human right, and so should free-higher-education.\\r\\nGovernments should care about giving people higher education, evaluating what each person is good at and giving them the preparation to function in their best role in life and money should not ever be an issue.\\r\\nProjects like\\r\\nTHE LEDGER\\r\\n, by the Institute for the Future (IFTF) already thought of it all, they have a project that will be in full affect in 2026.\\r\\nWith The Ledger, people will be able to have all their skills recorded on an easy to manage application, where they will also be able to teach and learn new skills.\\r\\nOne of their goals is to earn as you learn, it opens the horizon for anyone interested in learning and teaching.\\r\\nI encourage you to watch their video to understand the proposal of the application, it just sounds too good to be true, but it is a legitimate project that would never have been possible if it was not for the blockchain technology.\\r\\nSony\\r\\nand\\r\\nIBM\\r\\nare working on platforms to share student’s records, certificates transcripts and more. E-portfolios will be available for all academic credentials. These projects are already in full effect.\\r\\nConclusion:\\r\\nThe blockchain platform system represents\\r\\na trust protocol\\r\\nin our modern educational systems. It is changing how, who and when we get to go to school.\\r\\nThis is the future of education, leading us into a bright future where education isn’t just for the rich and fortunate but for everyone.\\r\\nPlaces where people could not get to go to school,\\r\\nthere will be schools\\r\\n, because where ever we can get internet connection there will be blockchain, and if there is blockchain there will be education.\\r\\nAnd once the new educational systems are fully operating there will only be one question left:\\r\\nhow did we ever live without it?',\n",

       "  'body': 'Leah Sharibu: The value of no.\\r\\nOn the 19th of February when news broke of the kidnap of 110 student of Dapchi Government Girls Secondary School (GGSS) by Boko Haram, the anticipated public reaction was the expression of unfiltered frustration on why Dapchi was the Chibok that should never have happened. Indeed the Nigerian public was prepared to pressure and did pressured the government to secure the ‘unconditional’ release of the students. What the public was not prepared for was the unsettling story of a courageous young girl, defiant and resilient in the face of terror; we were not prepared for the story of Leah Sharibu.\\r\\nLeah’s story emerged on March 21, after the negotiated release of\\r\\n104 out of 110\\r\\nschoolgirls; 5 of the students were reported death. Leah was reportedly held back for refusing to denounce her Christian faith. While it’s tempting to interpret her ordeal from a religious perspective, it is worth emphasizing that it will amount to yielding to the divisive desires of Boko Haram, her captors. But today offers us a unique opportunity to expand the frame of reference beyond religion, beyond settled individual theories, but towards our broader purpose as a country, and how Leah fits into it.\\r\\nLeah’s refusal to denounce her faith in the face danger has been a source of unspoken skepticism. This skepticism is often reserved for conversations around kitchen and dining tables. I once heard a man who suggested that Leah could have been more expedient, craftier even. He claimed that if caught in similar circumstance, he will “play smart by renouncing his faith hoping that God will understand.” To be clear these were not attempts at extenuating the severity of Leah’s circumstance, but sincere attempts aimed at understanding the foundations of her convictions. We can’t pretend not to have heard or had these conversations, not because we desire to have them, but because these are products of honest, protective desires. These are conversations needed to create the psychological adjustment necessary to accommodate her courageous predisposition.\\r\\nWhile it is intuitive to desire that she had responded differently, it is worth considering that Leah is just not like most of us. Demonstrably, her sense of extended-purpose overwhelmed the instinctive desire for self preservation. When Leah said no to the demands of her abductors, she said yes to the freedoms that bound us as a country, she said yes to the liberties promised in our constitutions. 225 days since Leah was violently separated from her family by Boko Haram, there is little publicly acknowledged effort being made to secure her release.\\r\\nIn August, a proof of life audio where Leah pleaded for government to facilitate her freedom was released by Boko Haram. The public outcry that followed the proof of life audio, extracted the most considered commitment from the government, reassuring the public of its commitment to her safe release. Despite expressing this commitment, the unfortunate execution of Saifura Khorsa, a midwife with the International Committee of Red Cross by Boko Haram, and the accompanied threats to unleash similar horror on Leah and all others in circumstances similar to hers’ immediately renders all previous efforts at their rescue insufficient and dissatisfying.\\r\\nYes the government negotiated the release of 104 Dapchi schoolgirls, yes some abducted Chibok schoolgirls have been released, but Leah and all in a situation similar to hers’ have been in captivity for too long. The Sustained anticipatory horror of waiting in vain for their release has cost unimaginable suffering. The government must act with the urgency that is consistent with this reality, this urgency is needed especially in a dispensation where indecisiveness is increasingly seen as the most abiding doctrine of our government.\\r\\nOn the 14th May 2018, Far from home, far from her parents, yet intimately connected to her courage and to her faith, Leah endured her\\r\\nFifteenth birthday\\r\\nin captivity. At a time when several issues are competing for government’s attention, it becomes our responsibility to speak for the voiceless, protest for the unseen. Individually, we might be unable to restore her stolen innocence, but together we can restore to her the inherent dignity in liberty.\\r\\nWe can’t let the shock of her captivity wear off. Because when Leah said “no,” she demonstrated a courageous commitment to the inherent liberty of the human soul. Her “no” was a call to defend the freedom of belief, which is a fundamental aspect of our society that deserves our shared allegiance. Her “no” was a refusal to exchange our most sacred values for our desperation.\\r\\nAS we mark Nigeria’s 58 independence, as we honor this moment of national solidarity, we should remember that a country with unsafe spaces for her most vulnerable population must have its independence thoughtfully reevaluated. And use the opportunity to alter the frame of reference away from Leah Sharibu but towards ourselves: What will you do when your sacred values are demanded in exchange for your desperation?',\n",

       "  'body': 'The sad thing about learning within rural areas is how even when you have the best teachers in the village, the facilities available are usually not conducive of optimal learning. Books are so scarce, students have to share. Classrooms are dilapidated, they don’t protect the children from the weather. Add to that the miles that learners need to walk to reach the school in the first place.\\r\\nAnd it’s not like education in African history used to be that inconvenient. In his paper critically examining the approaches that were employed by Africans in their knowledge acquisition and skill-capacity building before and after colonization, Mosweunyane mentioned that African education consisted of a combination of both intellectual and manual labor which meant that teachers imparted skills which could be put to use immediately. Additionally, the teacher in pre-colonial Africa was a life-long learner who never stopped learning.\\r\\nWith this understanding of the African market, we developed a learning program based on the “classroom in a bag” model. As the name suggests, the idea is for trainers to be able to carry the entire classroom within a backpack. Consisting of multiple tablets, a charging unit, a micro-projector, a speaker, and a central device that contained all the content that we call the Ruka, the classroom can be set up wherever the learners naturally congregate.\\r\\nWhile for many people around the world, it’s easy to google something whenever they’re looking for the answer to a question, there are many barriers that need to be overcome before that. Learners need to have a smartphone, and even if they have a smartphone, they need to be connected to the internet, and even if they can connect to the internet and find youtube, the content needs to be in their local language.\\r\\nOur model overcomes these barriers as learners get the tablets when the bag reaches them, the content can be accessed off the grid without requiring the internet, and the videos concisely address the problems they have and how to solve them, and its localized in their own language.\\r\\nThe internet is usually required only when the content needs to be upgraded. What makes this model work is anyone can be trained to be a trainer thus putting no ceiling to how scalable it could be.\\r\\nAnd because you can teach people where they naturally congregate anyway, a lesson could be set up at any baraza. This also works in environments where the society is conservative so girls are not allowed to attend some learning or training sessions for social reasons.\\r\\nTo read more about the programs where this Classroom in a Bag model has worked,\\r\\ncheck out this case study to educate farmers on best practices\\r\\n.\\r\\nReference\\r\\nD.

It is my hope they never have to do what Christine Blasey Ford did this past week in front of sniveling senators and gawking onlookers alike on national television.\\r\\nI, of course, did not watch the hearings because I was working. Apparently, though, plenty of you were watching as all the networks had bonzo ratings.\\r\\nIn the clips I have seen, and I’ve seen plenty, the most moving line she said in her testimony was in response to a question asking about her most vivid memory. She answered with the\\r\\nlaughter\\r\\n. “They were laughing with each other,” she said.\\r\\nLaughing.\\r\\nI have no doubt in my mind that Brett Kavanaugh did exactly what Dr. Ford outlined. I also have no doubt he has absolutely no recollection of it. Not because he was blitzed out of his mind like a 17-year-old after drinking 1 or 2 or 12 too many, but because it was inconsequential to him. It didn’t mean anything to him.\\r\\nIt was life changing to Ford. It was another Saturday to Kavanaugh.\\r\\nHe believes, as do far too many others, that it was no big deal. He denies it, of course, because in his mind it wasn’t important enough to remember. It’s why his spittle and anger at the audacity of someone impugning his character is so enraging. It was no big deal.\\r\\nIt was a big deal for Dr. Ford. She remembers. It affected her for the rest of her life. For example, she insisted on double front doors when remodeling her home because of the trauma.\\r\\nWhen she learned Kavanaugh was on the short list to become a Supreme Court judge, she called her representatives to let them know what happened to her. She believed it was her civic duty. There was no left-wing conspiracy to derail Trump’s nominee.\\r\\nIn his testimony,\\r\\nwhen confronted by Senator Dick Durbin about what Kavanaugh himself wanted in regards to an actual FBI investigation he shut down\\r\\n. He stopped talking. Kavanaugh had no answer because he couldn’t say he wanted an investigation and welcomed a look at his personal life, his yearbook comments, his friends, his drinking, and his partying.

       " {'title': 'Atheism, a new\\xa0faith?',\n",
       "  'body': 'We\\r\\nall need faith in something or someone\\u200a—\\u200afaith in the existence of a superior being or in its non existence. And as you already are aware, as theists put their faith in religion so do atheists in the latter. But there’s a loophole in both the arguments. How can we base our arguments on the existence or non-existence of God on the basis of actions of men?\\r\\nReligion invariably follows upon the word of God. And it is the word of God that is truly the basis of the argument between these theists and atheists. And these words of God were spoken to certain specific men by God himself. While it is impossible to ascertain God speaking to the mind of men as much as it is impossible to ascertain the existence of God himself, how could a believer or a non-believer base the arguments on something that is just as inconceivable. For all we know, that it was written by a common man advertising it to be the word of God, which would make it the word of a man. While it does seem ridiculous that certain men were spoken to by God, I know that believers base their faith in these texts and believe it to be truly the word of God, but wouldn’t one also need to have a faith in the non-existence of God for him to straight away discard the theory which is based on nothing else but the irrelevance of the religious texts written by a human being from his own mind (as atheists would believe it to be).\\r\\nIsn’t it just as arrogant of us to be trying to prove that we are the only superior species as much as we would be arrogant to be proving that we were made the superior species on Earth by God in his own image? While science answers a lot many questions and refutes the word of a man in these spiritual texts of belief (which we are going to assume to be word of men, since it’s hard to prove it either way), it cannot explain why the origin happened. Scientists have to have the belief that the universe does have secrets which are to be unfurled by their research. Which invariably means that the universe is an intelligible entity in itself. There are patterns yet to be established. And there has to be faith in these patterns, in these secrets, that scientists need to put to establish that there are laws governing the universe. Why does the universe need to follow any pattern at all? While a theist would explain it with the example of God and atheist with science, none would be able to answer why the universe need to exist at all. Whether you’re a believer or a non believer you’d still be asking the same questions\\u200a—\\u200awhy do we exist, what is our purpose and other such existentialistic questions.\\r\\nIs atheism a Godless religion? Atheism singles out each men as the product of their own principles. You cannot form groups in these atheistic approach as that would mean the following of a single set of principles. The only principle uniting atheists is the non existence of God. While religions are defined by God, I think it would rather be an improvement to view religious beliefs and God as mutually exclusive entities. While religion is a set of principles to be followed on the word of God and believing that it is the word of God, God is a superior entity in whom you believe in or not. It may be argued that the principles of religion are the word of God, but it’s inconceivable how somebody who believes in the empathy and sympathy of God and his considering all of us important could believe in every word of the religious texts, that is supposedly the word of God, which could harm another human being. So why are we providing arguments against the existence of God and not against the harmful beliefs alone? Why bring an unprovable entity in the arguments which should be based on the provable wrongful beliefs?\\r\\nThe moral dilemmas of religion can also be found in a non-religious society. While human beings may not be as sensitive to the harms to those not directly related to them, most religions or unreligious men would preach humanity. But does that sentiment or moral sense come through a superior being or from the sensibilities of a religion free society? Humanity, although it may not be the right term here, is a moral compass followed by a majority of the animals who’d protect their kin from dangers, even though they have no clue of whether God exists or not.\\r\\nIn this regard, anybody advocating atheism is no different from another person advocating theism. Atheism is a form of religion too, just devoid of a superior being. Atheists just have the advantage of advertising their relevantly new religion in a society questioning all the principles that it has been believing in. The base argument for or against religion and a superior being is the atrocities done in the name of religion. While I do not think any argument for or against God would help anyone for the better, the topic we should probably be arguing on\\u200a—\\u200awhile keeping an open mind\\u200a—\\u200ashould rather be the texts or words that are taken out of proportion in religion, written in an age of a different set of principles that people lived by and which are not relevant or humane or even logical to be followed by the collective set of believers. We don’t need to be purging human beings on the basis of difference in principles, rather should be purging the illogical principles themselves.\\r\\nThe book ‘Sapiens’ speaks about how stories were a cause of the unification of Homo sapiens, them growing as groups and probably the source of religion. Are we sure that atheism isn’t just another story that we are telling ourselves?',\n",

       "  'body': 'At Apple in the early ’90s, my UX team and I observed how people organize information. We were looking for fresh ideas and real issues we could address. Our key finding: loose organization schemes\\u200a—\\u200athat is, piles of stuff\\u200a—\\u200aare super useful. They allow us to keep current work ready at hand. We can avoid having to name and file things away. Piles are forgiving\\u200a—\\u200athey don’t need to be narrowly defined, their disheveled nature is part of their attraction.\\r\\nExpanding the desktop to include Piles\\u200a—\\u200ain addition to folders\\u200a—\\u200aseemed like an interesting idea to pursue.\\r\\nWe suggested piles as a useful metaphor to our collaborators in the information retrieval group. Perhaps piles could appropriately represent clustering algorithm outcomes? They ran with it, and we proceeded to design, iterate and test piling user interfaces and interactions to add to the Apple Operating System.\\r\\nWe wrote\\r\\npapers\\r\\n. We were granted a\\r\\npatent\\r\\n. We assembled a compendium of design rationale supporting the work which I shopped all around Apple. I presented at the WWDC in 1992. We received a lot of attention and enthusiasm for the work. But…it didn’t ship. I left Apple at the end of 1993.\\r\\nFlash forward to 2018.\\r\\nOS Mojave\\r\\nships in September and includes a feature called Stacks. It’s clearly derivative of our work (although that’s not been officially verified). People who remember the early work say we were prescient, way ahead of our time. That’s flattering, but not completely true. It’s not that we came up with these designs out of thin air. Rather, we tapped into ideas with enduring appeal because we invested time in understanding people and their needs and designing for them.\\r\\nThe truth is, people don’t change much. Our research into how people organized things in the ‘90s is completely valid today. It was a pain to file things away then, it’s still a pain to put things away now. Computer desktops are just as ready for computer-assisted organization features as they were 30ish years ago.\\r\\nUnderstanding your users and their motivations provides valuable insights. That understanding doesn’t go stale; the features and functions derived from it have longevity. Technology is moving much faster than human evolution (even if it sometimes seems most people have grown iPhone hand extensions). There are certainly as many humans with messy desktops today as there were in 1990.\\r\\nHowever, there are myriad different decisions that go into launching a product feature. Just because it’s a good or useful doesn’t mean it is going to ship. Today, we talk a lot about MVPs and product roadmaps, aiming to balance competing priorities. Marketing, positioning, engineering, software development, and other concerns play a solid role in determining what deserves to ship at any given time.\\r\\nPresumably, over the years, many other features were prioritized and productized instead of piles; tradeoffs were made. Even though other considerations led Apple to put off shipping Stacks until now, it’s always been right for humans.',\n",

       " {'title': 'Greed is not\\xa0good',\n",
       "  'body': 'Thirty years ago, in the iconic scene from the film Wall Street, the antagonist Gordon Gekko declares that\\r\\n“Greed, for lack of a better word, is good”\\r\\n. The film and the line in particular, not the larger morality play central to the movie, justified and inspired wall street players of today like no other. While Ayn Rand came before, and provides a sense of philosophical underpinnings that say the same thing-the central philosophy of Randism can be summarized by that one iconic line.\\r\\nRand, Rockwell, Rothbard, Hayek, Friedman-they all establish this central principle. But every single attempt to explain the notion of libertarianism is presented as if the greed expressed is for the aggrieved worker, suffering nobly only to have the fruit of his labors clawed away by self-interested bureaucrats too lazy to work for themselves or incompetent do-gooders, foolishly giving away to the undeserving. Libertarian belief is a wonderful, noble celebration of the hard workers who through elbow grease, suffering and moxie make their living.\\r\\nBut, when the little dog pulls the curtain away, all libertarian policy ends up boiling down to greed. Not greed in the sense of keeping what you’ve earned, but keeping everything that everyone else has earned as well. This belief has been so ensconced in our system that we codify it into the basics of our economic language.\\r\\nThe biggest and most glaring of these is the term “investment”. The classical term meant a personal investment of time, wealth and passion. Can any investor say they put their passion into their investments? Can you even name the companies or commodities your investments serve?\\r\\nI tried to find this out with my 401k, which is the only stock I own, provided by Vanguard. I spent a day searching what I was allowed to see about my portfolio, but there was not a single mention of any company or stock. I could see my bonds, certainly, but the stocks are opaque to me. I couldn’t even tell you what companies I am nominally invested in.\\r\\nNow, there is nothing saying I can’t invest my money directly in a publicly traded company that I believe in or work for. I could take all of my salary and, instead of doing things like pay rent or eat-just invest in Apple. (I could also buy an iPhone instead of paying rent or eating, but that’s neither here nor there). That would be investment. That would be taking my time and my money and presumably my passion making the investment. But that’s not what I’m talking about.\\r\\nMost wealth in the world is made through investment of money. Not investment of time or passion. Stock portfolios are smatterings of many publicly traded companies in large sectors, shuffling about in various ways that are mostly opaque to their owners. The owners of said portfolios, like myself with my little 401k, are largely uninterested in the particulars of what companies, so long as it’s working and returning money.\\r\\nIn other words, as an investor, I am not interested in the success of companies or people outside of myself. I am not invested in anything except for my own naked self interest. Like the fleas on a dog, investors care about the dog’s health only inasmuch as they care about how they benefit directly from stealing the health of the dog for myself. If the dog were to die, it is of no consequence, so long as another healthy host is nearby.\\r\\nAs a simple example, let’s take the game of monopoly. If you were to add an investment layer to the game, a prudent investor would wisely invest in any property that has a monopoly built over one that does not. The structural advantage is huge. This would then facilitate the building of houses and eventually hotels. The owner of the properties makes money and the investor makes money.\\r\\nBut in our modern investment scheme, the savvy investor doesn’t invest in any particular player, but merely a portfolio of properties that are already in a good position. Let’s say that’s three different property sets. Each one gets money to build their hotels, but the first one to take a bad hit and have to sell those hotels or in some way loses the monopoly is dropped to help buttress the other investments. The “investor” doesn’t care about anything except their own profits, and the previously invested in monopoly is no longer a good host for the parasite, so it moves on.\\r\\nInvesting in the modern context is greedy and parasitic, and the investor class is clear about this, as displayed by actions (and sometimes words). On February 19, 2015 Walmart announced a massive investment in it’s employee workforce-creating more jobs and increasing pay. The immediate result was a 3.2% drop in share price. April 26, 2017 American Airlines announced pay raises for flight crew across the board. The predictable reaction from wall street:\\r\\n“Frustrating. Labor is being paid first again. Shareholders get leftovers.”\\r\\nAA’s share priced dropped over 8%. Again, who cares about the health of the host so long as the fleas are fed?\\r\\nBut let’s be clear-there still exists, as mentioned above, the investment of time, money and passion. These forms of investment are ultimately for long term success, and ought to be rewarded. But, this form of investment is a miniscule fraction of the overall picture of what we consider investing.\\r\\nAnd this is why the language needs to change. We should no longer conflate opportunists, parasites and gamblers with investors. There’s a mythology idealized corporate parasites as benign job creators, providing the support and nurturing that grants the laborer the ability to create his or her own fortune. The laborer needs only realize that the investor is not interested in the success of any plurality, but only in their own private success, and the moment the laborer is of no use to the parasite class, the parasites move on.\\r\\nThe parasite class finds refuge in Gekko/Rand philosophy, because it whitewashes their greed as a form of social good. It is a comforting lie, but it is ultimately a lie. The conservative boogiemen of lazy, undeserving, uncontributing members of society living off the efforts of the hardworking laborers do exist. The problem is, those same people are the ones rightwing economic policy always benefits.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Sooner or later you meet people that challenge your own thoughts and beliefs. There is no way around it and actively avoiding these encounters does more harm than good in the long-term. The possibility that these confrontations introduce new meaningful information is in no way slight. It is therefore important to realize you may be incorrect about some things and to take a rational look at the matter at hand instead of blindly defending false assumptions or innate biases. The world we live in is incredibly complex and while we are able to act properly in it we remain oblivious to most of its nuances.\\r\\nIt took countless smart people hundreds of years to construct what we have today. There is no way you could possibly know and understand everything. Even with the head start of the education system and the vast power of the Internet. There is also no need to know and understand everything. A few proficiencies and a common understanding of everything else is enough for you to function properly in society.\\r\\nTo reduce the anxiety caused by the incredibly complex environment you often abstract things. There is a reason the computer started as a black box. It doesn’t matter how it functions as long it does what you want. But the moment something breaks inside it transforms into a complex interplay of electronic parts that’s not even useful anymore. This process of reducing composite things to single entities allows you to interact with them without studying their underlying structure or ways of functioning.\\r\\nThere is, of course, a caveat to it. By abstracting an entity, you lose some information about it. Moreover, different abstractions of the same entity leave different nuances out, for they are often used in narrow contexts. This leaves you in a situation where you think you know the whole entity but are rather only familiar with one or few of its abstractions. It is therefore possible that, while making a decision based on abstractions, you are lacking knowledge and information, which may indeed be relevant to your situation.\\r\\nCommunication, on the other hand, is the process of exchanging information about a certain topic. You mostly compare your knowledge with that of others. In the case of conflicting understandings, you start an argument. Building and defending reasonable cases for and against a statement defines a healthy conversation. In doing so you learn new information and more importantly discover that your opinion has flaws or may even be objectively wrong. This expands your knowledge base and educates you for the upcoming future. Although it is possible for one side of the discussion to be factually wrong, it is more likely that both sides are correct to a certain extent, and the degree of accuracy depends on the context.\\r\\nAccepting someone else’s point of view on an issue that can be very challenging. It implies admitting you were wrong and ignorant up until now. It means that your counterpart has somewhat superior knowledge to you. It hints that the way you have chosen to take through life wasn’t the best one possible. What else you know is incorrect? How can you be so ignorant? This is the line of thought most people follow. It blows the issue out of proportion and brings a great deal of anxiety and resentment. You don’t want to seem ignorant or uneducated, for it reduces your social status. Sometimes you may even think your opinions are part of their identity and changing them would be a betrayal towards yourself. It is therefore a lot easier to dismiss the newly acquired facts and blindly defend your position while continuing living your old live.\\r\\nThe real response should be to admit you were wrong and ignorant and start implementing the newly acquired knowledge in your life from this moment forward. This essentially means killing parts of yourself based on false presupposition and replacing them with better ones. Those actions are like small sacrifices you need to make for your own personal sake. You could have learned this earlier and thus avoided some mistakes, but not making them ever again is an awful lot better than continuing the old path. For you cannot alter the past, but rather build the future you desire.\\r\\nHaving arguments should be about learning new information. Sharing opposing thoughts on a matter should be about being curious what your counterparts knows that you don’t and vise-versa. Changing your opinion should not be suppressed by your ego and pride but rather encouraged by them. Like objects in your backpack, your opinions, thoughts and beliefs should be replaceable if you find better ones. Being right means always being able to change your opinion. At the end of the day, it is your own responsibility to improve yourself and live a better life.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Of all the countries in the world, Bharat-varsha or India brims with traditions, customs, cultures and communal diversity. In this part of the world or the universe, people of different faiths, sections or cultures unite and celebrate various festivals. Navratri is one of the vibrant festivals celebrated across the country. It is popularly known as Durga Puja in some parts prominently West Bengal. Devotees gather and worship Shakti who manifests Herself in Her nine divine forms. She is also known as Durga. During this festival, people sing and recite holy scriptures that glorify Durga and Her battle against demons. One can see the temples of Durga and houses decorated with fragrant flowers and lights.\\r\\nIdols of Durga are placed at home and in the pandals (tents in public places) wherein people can sight the beautiful and divine Durga who is ever ready to bless Her devotees. Families attend the prayers in those pandals and take the remnants (prasadam) of food offered to the goddess.\\r\\nFasting:\\r\\nApart from other spiritual festivities, fasting during the nine days of Navratri takes prominence. Devotees observe strict or partial fast in order to please the goddess. On the other side, fasting plays an important role in detoxifying your boy. When no food or permitted food items are consumed, the internal workings of the body get replenished with newer energy and additional\\r\\njatharagni\\r\\n(fire to digest food). All the senses including the mind become purified and calm. Being in such a state of mind and body, one devotes themselves to Durga and experiences a spiritual bliss within and without the body.\\r\\nWhen it comes to fasting, there are two ways to follow; strict fast and partial fast. The first involves consumption of water only. And the second includes the intake of permitted eatables such as sabudana, lemon juice, buttermilk, lassi fruits, nuts and milk. Most of us find it difficult to observe strict fasting (water only) for nine days. Let us see what we can have in case of following partial fast.\\r\\nFlours\\r\\n: If you are observing fast and want to have items alternative to those made from the flours, you can have items made of buckwheat, Water chestnut flour (Singhare), Rajgira etc.\\r\\nEnjoying Fruits:\\r\\nFruits are the best nutrition-giving agents during your fast. You can have pears, coconut water, pomegranates, apples, pineapples, oranges and melons the so on.\\r\\nDry fruits:\\r\\nDry fruits are rich sources of proteins and energy. During your Navratri fast, you can enjoy having almonds, walnuts, cashew and raisins as they would give you enough stamina.\\r\\nTaking Vegetables\\r\\n: You can have Potato, pumpkin, sweet potato, colocasia, papaya, curry patta, lemon and Yams (suran). One is not allowed to have wheat items, onion and garlic in their diet during Navratri fast.\\r\\nSalt To Taste:\\r\\nDuring Navratri, it is better to have rock salt (sendha namak) which is specifically available for fating. In the Ayurveda, rock salt acts as a cooling spice best for laxative and digestive system.\\r\\nSpices and oil\\r\\n: You can use spices such as black cumin, elaichi, poppy seeds, black chilly (Sabut) etc. as that are allowed during Navratri fasting and olive oil and desi ghee in cooking\\r\\nDairy Items:\\r\\nYou can have all milk products such as yoghurt, cream and paneer if you are on fast during the nine days of Navratri fasting.\\r\\nRef:\\r\\nhttps://www.onlymyhealth.com/foods-allowed-during-navratri-fast-1317194190',\n",

It was also part of the course project of Object-oriented programming with java on coursera, and I got to play around with it for a while and here’s series of tutorials about things I learned.You can find the entire source code of the program\\r\\nhere\\r\\n.\\r\\nUnfolding Maps can be installed in two ways as described in the installation\\r\\ndocumentation\\r\\n.\\r\\nWe use the second method and touch upon the processing library in the next tutorial. Please\\r\\nDownload\\r\\nand Install the latest version of Eclipse before you proceed.\\r\\nThe template comes with a sample map, and we change it a little bit to make it look good and work efficiently.\\r\\nAfter importing the project create a new Class from File -> New -> Class in eclipse and name it Whatever you want. In this tutorial, I have named it\\r\\nUnfoldingVisual.\\r\\nPlease note that your class name that overrides the setup and draw or main method should match the name of the file. (This is usually a rule in Java).\\r\\nYour class file should look similar to code given below.You can also Copy and Paste the below code.\\r\\nChange the Map Provider to OpenStreetMap as its an open source project and lets us test without any rate limit.

       "  'body': 'This piece was written and performed as part of #NYWF2018, for the Women and Femmes reading event on Thursday evening.\\r\\nI want to talk about powerful Femme Ana Pascal, from the film\\r\\nStranger Than Fiction\\r\\n. This film, it’s all about the power of femmes and of literature. It’s perfect. What better a place than a writers festival to talk about the movie that makes books better; that made me better.\\r\\nFemme is a queer identity that I hold onto strongly. Up the top, I wanna create the distinction as separate from feminine, which is a wonderful adjective for appearance. Capital F Femme, as in Queer Femme, as in the femme of magic and marvel, this is what I love, and what I love doesn’t really let itself be explained easily.\\r\\nMy partner is currently studying queer femininity, and when I have asked her in the past what her work has unveiled about a possible definition for this term is, she first laughs at me, and then shrugs, soft shoulders all the way up to her ears. There is a mystery to Femme, an unknowing, and yet in many ways, a wish to be known. Perhaps just an obfuscation, the painted face behind the fan. We continue, regardless\\u200a—\\u200athe definition may never come but we will.\\r\\nAna Pascal, from the film\\r\\nStranger Than Fiction\\r\\n, plays a small but crucial part of an ensemble full of extraordinary women. There are two other women of note, but that counts as full of women for a modern movie still, so I take it where I can get it. Alongside professional, intelligent and formidable, the woman you call when no one else will do, Penny Escher, and award winning novelist and total relatable anxious wreck Karen Eiffel, she is surrounded by women who flesh out their own worlds.\\r\\nAnd yet Ana stands out. Ana Pascal, sweet bisexual firebrand, Harvard law drop out, anarchist baker, and powerful, beautiful Femme. My heart belongs to you, and this is a love poem.\\r\\nOh Ana Pascal, that you are described through the gaze of the main character Harold whatever-his-face is relevant, it’s a part of you, the way that Femmes are so often viewed through lenses not of our own making or polishing, but remake ourselves despite this.\\r\\nYour clear bisexuality is like my own, not letting men in until they’ve shown themselves to be able to give more, do more, be more. You are the pivot of the film, remaking Harold’s life for a betterment that changes his future until he learns to dream of something bigger than himself in turn. Femmes are sometimes mistaken for the manic pixie dream girls of film’s murky making, but we also constantly seek to change ourselves, to better ourselves. There is so much room for expansion, and we kick at it. We do not settle, we do not sit still.\\r\\nAna Pascal, last name from Blaise Pascal, French mathematician and philosopher. her heart and soul stems from someone who thought bigger, thought of the conditions of better, and dreamed for them. Darling Ana, who figured if she was going to make the world a better place she’d do it with cookies.\\r\\nAna Pascal, Harvard law drop out, who went to college so she could make the world a better place, who addresses a letter to the tax office “Dear Imperialist Swine?” like I am still tempted to do some days\\u200a—\\u200aall this bloody women’s work that needs to be done and I’d hope for at least some kind of tax write-off for my lipstick.\\r\\nAna Pascal, sweet darling pastry chef, making\\r\\noatmeal cookies, peanut butter bars, and dark chocolate macadamia nut wedges\\r\\n, bringing joy to the people studying around you, to your community. a linch pin for those who sought to create change.\\r\\nSoon it was ricotta cheese and apricot croissants, and mocha bars with an almond glaze, and lemon chiffon cake with a zesty peach icing\\r\\n. Her tattooed arms kneading dough, in and out across the sturdy benchtop, pressing fingertips, flour stippled across her brow and her collarbones; Femmes as strength as much as they are sustenance.\\r\\nAna Pascal, radical queer with a capital fuck you, who names her bakery The Uprising, and serves local undernourished and homeless people because someone has to, and so she does. She dives into love after checking the water, she feels, she yearns, she wants. The myth of feminine desire as a dry pool is long gone, and Femmes are wet, sticky, pulsing like surf. When the storm surge hits, you know Femmes are about.\\r\\nAna Pascal, kind, charming giver of care. You are not wife material, you are star material, you are matter and atoms spun up with love or chance or something bigger again. The universe breathes you into being and you use that breath to look after others. This film, it’s all about the power of Femmes and of literature, and how what makes us better is what’s worth keeping around, growing from, finding more of.\\r\\nAna Pascal, lying on the hospital bed of someone you love, scared silly and thankful. The film ends with the author Karen Eiffel narrating, as she says:\\r\\nAnd in my mind, nothing could be more Femme than that.',\n",

       "  'body': 'M\\r\\nark had been furious when he got to know that his son Dieter had been attending Hitler’s speeches again, instead of going to his school. He often scolded Dieter severely for playing truant. But Dieter wasn’t the person to listen to his father; he thought his father was being over protective towards him and was forbidding to exercise his freedom. Dieter was seventeen years old and he would soon turn eighteen in this October, which meant that he would turn in to an adult.\\r\\nMark Otto Franck Wielberg was a clerk in Ministry of War, in the German National People’s Party. He previously had been a lieutenant in the Imperial German Army, but was sent back home after two months he joined the army due to severe injuries in his left leg, after a grenade exploded in front of him in the Battle of Somme.\\r\\nAfter he was sent back, he always walked with a limp as that wound didn’t heal properly. He was a man who man who loved peace, but to his great misfortune he never achieved it completely. The wars broke the most amount of peace, that’s why he hated wars, especially The Great War. He absolutely loathed it. It had taken his Vianne away from him. She was his beloved wife, who had never failed to love and support him through all the times.\\r\\nShe had died, when a cluster bomb fell on her during the heavy air raids on Berlin by the Royal Air Corps in 1916, leaving innocent and child Dieter motherless. From then on Mark’s sister Dorna had taken care of Dieter as Mark had never remarried.\\r\\nMark had been always overprotective about Dieter, after all Dieter was his only son after Dieter’s two brothers had died out of small pox and the bubonic plague. And after Vianne had died, Mark was even more overprotective about Dieter. He had sent Dieter to his French grandparents during the 1918 communist uprising in Germany, fearing that Dieter might have been harmed during the period of violence by the communists. And when Dieter had fallen from a low tree and had bruised his leg badly, Mark had been frantic about treatment of his son’s leg. He had consulted many doctors to finally know that his sons leg will completely after a few weeks. His neighbors complained that he was being over-protective. But he simply turned a deaf ear to their complains and responded every time, like a tape-recorder these very words, “A have lost a piece of my heart already. And I don’t want to lose the other one too.”\\r\\nDieter Ulrich Schuler Wielberg wasn’t a a quiet and peace-loving like his father. He liked violence, the company of other people, and most of all he liked Hitler. He liked Hitler because, he like many patriotic Germans in The Weimar Republic, Dieter thought that Hitler could bring back the Fatherland back to its previous glorious days, but he lacked helped to accomplish his target. So to provide help to Fatherland’s last hope he, secretly, had become a member of the Sturmabteilung. He had told this news to nobody, and of course, not even to his father.\\r\\nHe become a SA member because he was tired of standing in the long queues in front of the butchers and miller’s shop. He was tired of eating only hard bread, cold liver of the chicken or any half-rancid cold bacon. He was tired of having daily fistfights with thieves who tried to steal his and his father’s only rationed ‘food’ and ‘clothes’. He was tired of having only his basic necessities, unlike those spend-thrift Americans who had no idea of the value of money, and burnt billions of dollars on good food, hotels, wine,etc; he was jealous of their good lives. And lastly, he was tired of the worthless government of the worthless Weimar Republic\\xa0.\\r\\nThey were unable to do anything to progress in the people’s lives, and decrease the rate of unemployment through out the country, since 1923. Dieter wanted everyone’s lives to become better and and more prosperous. So, he thought of changing the government, and the first step was to join the SA. He could have joined the communists in the hope of achieving his dreams, but he didn’t.\\r\\nLike many other Germans, he believed in what Hitler said, “ The communists and the Jews are the cause of the Fatherland’s downfall. To bring back the Fatherland’s lost glory, we must boycott them\\xa0!”. Thus, Dieter was loyal and ardent hater of communists and Jews. He was anti-Jewish and anti-communist to such extent, that he had beaten up two Jewish students and one boy whose father was a communist. As a result, he was suspended from school for a fortnight. And had his pocket money cut for a month.\\r\\nBut still his hatred towards the Jews hadn’t lessened even minutely. And he had never missed even one speech of Hitler. As a result, he often played truant and often got scolded by his father on this subject. But all the same he never listened to his father.\\r\\n“Dieter, why did you skip school again, even after numerous time I have scolded, screamed, and disapproved of this act so vociferously? Why don’t you listen to me? What harm have I caused to you for the fact that you’re showing utter disrespect to my words? And why are you so hell bent in tarnishing my so hardly built reputation? Why are you silent? Answer them immediately!” Mark burst out the moment Dieter had entered the Wielberg Haus.\\r\\nDieter had been stunned at the sudden fusillade of questions. For a second, he felt confused about how to react in the next moment. He felt stupid at standing in front of the open door and staring blindly and dumbly at his aged father. Then after digesting the questions and synthesizing them, he responded in an exasperated tone, “Father let’s not start again on this futile topic. I am fed up of listening to you and; you’re so overprotective as if I am an ice cube which would melt if it came into the contact with the room temperature. Let me live my own life in my own way. And stop poking your nose in my business!’’\\r\\n“Don’t you dare tell me I am being overprotective or I am prying in your life as if I am an complete stranger. You hardly know how to take care of yourself; you mix with a bunch of stupid hoodlums who always wear brown shirts and a black swastika on their arms and disturb the peace of our quiet neighborhood by harassing our neighbors without any valid reason.”\\r\\nThe SA was famous for beating up innocent Jews and communists all over Munich. Its notoriety was well respected by everyone. For once crossing their paths wouldn’t be very pleasant. So, let them do what they want to do and turn a blind eye or deaf ear to the nuisance yet so unbearable and inhumane, this was the motto of all Münchners.\\r\\n“Moreover, you listen to the speeches of that stupid leader of the stupid hoodlums instead of going to school, whose fees I pay painstakingly by listening, working, and doing the bidding of hundred people in the Ministry of War for twelve hours! Do you think, that I enjoy doing the nonsense they tell me do? And what was the name of that foolish and ambitious leader those hoodlums?’’A brief period of silence was followed while Mark recalled the SA’s leader’s name, but that didn’t last very long; a little more than five seconds.\\r\\n“Yes, the Bohemian Corporal. He is the leader of those goons. That nincompoop isn’t even a pure German. How paradoxical! He says a hundred others to kill the non-Germans, to be exact non-Aryans, then he should be the first person to be killed; he is neither a German nor an Aryan!’’ Saying that Mark slumped down on a wooden chair, breathing heavily due to firing questions at Dieter at a tremendous pace.\\r\\nDieter had been quiet for the entire time his father bad-mouthed, scoffed and spoke disdainfully of Hitler. But the last sentenced infuriated him. How could his father even utter such blasphemous sentences. How could he accuse Hitler of not being an Aryan.\\r\\n“Father first of all, Hitler has a name. He is not to be called ‘Bohemian Corporal’ as if he is just a lowly army man with no brains. He should have been a field marshal if those corrupted Jewish field marshals hadn’t discredited him.’’ This was one of the lies propagated by Hitler for his low rank. Though it was low experience in battlefield that resulted in his lowly position.\\r\\nDieter continued, “Second of all, he is a true Aryan. Though I agree that he was an Austrian by birth, he spoke German very well, listened to German music, stayed in Germany, etc. And it was his ill-fate that he was born in that useless country. Third of all, Hitler’s speeches are quite interesting and inspiring…..’’\\r\\n“Inspiring enough to be regarded as nonsense by everybody and the government.” Mark interjected and sneered at Dieter.\\r\\n“I don’t care what the government thinks or says; it is an incompetent group of people. And to enlighten you of Hitler’s\\r\\ntrue\\r\\nworth, he speaks sense. He says that National Socialism will get back the Fatherland’s lost pride. And he is right. Power should be in the hands of only one man and his decision would be the final decision. If power was divided and shared among a group of people, like it’s now, then the country would be in total disarray, same to the current position of Germany! Too many cooks spoil the broth. Besides, Hitler was a courageous soldier who fought with the Army till the end of the Great War. He wasn’t a weakhearted coward who was sent home immediately after the outbreak of the war for a minor wound, leaving his country defenseless!’’ Dieter replied scornfully.\\r\\nThe next action happened in a split second. Dieter’s cheek reddened and he could feel it heat up. Then realization came after a moment; his father has slapped him for the first time in his life. He’s was shocked for a movement, then he became infuriated and in anger he left his house, leaving his father alone who was weeping on the floor; repenting on his grave mistake of hitting his only son.\\r\\nRonald Reaver Stevens was an American by birth but most of his life was spent in Germany. He was a CIA agent who had helped in acquiring many secret plans of the Imperial German Army and German Navy for USA in the Great War. He looked very much like a German rather than a American; this was one of the things he had inherited from his German mother. He spoke German fluently as fluently as English. As a result he was a perfect agent to be assigned the work of spying on USSR as a Bavarian communist without being detected as a spy. And for this task he was given a fake identity of Hermann Werdaner\\xa0.\\r\\nThe CIA could do many such similar acts; Ronald’s cover was one of the easiest. Its most important task right now was to collect more information about the newly created Soviet Union and its current moves. Communism was spreading into Europe by mid 1920’s and it was big threat to the major capitalist countries; United Kingdom, France, Weimar Republic, etc. And eventually it posed the biggest threat to the influence of U.S. Thus, it was CIA’s job to know all the whereabouts of their Soviet counterpart.\\r\\nRonald’s works specialized and risky, for example infiltrating the German High Command’s office in order to know the German Empire’s next moves. As a result, he was give the task of acting as a Bavarian spy working for Moscow in Bavaria.\\r\\nHe was scheduled to deliver his reports to Moscow in the coming Sunday by acting as a train driver whose job was bring steel from USSR. On his ‘return’ to Moscow, he was supposed to spy on the Soviet intelligence department and infiltrate it in order to gain information about its future moves.\\r\\nSuddenly Ronald’s walkie-talkie beeps and presses the red button to receive the incoming call. A male voice speaks in a brisk manner, “Agent Hermann Werdaner you are to report to the CIA headquarters immediately tomorrow as soon as you land into the United States by catching the evening flight leaving from Berlin International Airport.”\\r\\nRonald was baffled to hear about the order of his sudden return to U.S, he cradled the walkie-talkie tightly and said, “Are you crazy? I am supposed to infiltrate into the Soviet Union tomorrow, and you inform me that I am suppose to abandon the mission and leave for U.S tonight without even giving proper valid reason! Are sure this is not misinformation or some practical joke that is being played on me?”\\r\\nThe man seemed to consider for a moment, to recover from the forceful questioning of Ronald, and then he said tartly, “You are to follow orders, Agent. Not to question them!’’ saying that the man cut the line with Ronald.\\r\\nRonald switches of his walkie-talkie and hails a taxi to take him to the Berlin International Airport, apprehensive of his unknown future tomorrow in CIA Headquarters in Virginia.\\r\\nTo be continued.',\n",

       "  'body': 'One of the principles of the twelve factor application is to move configuration into the environment. In back-end applications like Java, PHP, NodeJS, or Go software, that’s not a problem because the running application has access to the underlying operating system’s/container’s environment variables and local filesystem. However, the current state-of-the-art for front-end code seems to suggest two approaches. Neither of which are truly 12-factor friendly.\\r\\nThe first approach commonly suggested is to perform the npm run build (webpack build -p)when the container is started up. Now, this is actually a pretty sane approach at one level because the npm build process has access to environment variables. Bake the image containing the node_modules, and configure it as needed\\u200a—\\u200apassing in the environment variables into the container. However, that also means that the container now needs to have the bloat of all of the node_modules included in it. In my pretty simple react project\\xa0… that’s over 400 MEGABYTES of JavaScript and related assets. I’m not interested in shipping a half of a gigabyte in my containers every time I have a little update. There’s one more issue with that suggested approach and it’s that the npm-build process can be a bit sluggish. I don’t want my containers responsible for doing CI tasks that should be done on the build server. The container should have everything already built by the time it’s ready to serve internet traffic.\\r\\nThe second approach that is pretty sane is to create one container per environment. The benefit here is we consistently produce an image that’s tailor made for a given environment. However, I don’t really like this idea because I’d like to promote my containers through a pipeline. First, run it in beta\\xa0… play with it for a while, then promote that image into production. Doing one image per environment means that the pipeline concept is not viable because the environment variables are inextricably linked to the target environment.\\r\\nHere’s my current proposal based on late-night tinkering (Take my bash with a handful of salt because I haven’t totally sanity checked it. It’s PoC work): on boot of the container, run a bash script that does a find-and-replace of the environment variable values with the real ones for the current run-time environment.\\r\\nStarting with the env.js file that looks something like this\\r\\nNow becomes\\r\\nNow, we just need to find-and-replace any of the above occurrences with the corresponding JS_* environment variables. The following bash script is my first-pass at this and would be placed inside of the CMD portion of a docker container in order to perform a quick, inline replacement of our already compoiled JS files.\\r\\nThe reasons why I think this approach is better than the other approaches are as follows:\\r\\nThere are some obvious risks here as well though: First, this means that the bash script is doing something funky and could introduce some JavaScript bug. Second, we could cause unexpected issues by not properly sanitizing the environment variables prior to performing the sed in-place replacement. I’ve caught most of my edge-cases and if it’s broken\\xa0… it’s going to be pretty obvious.',\n",

       "  'body': '“Death may be the greatest of all human blessings.”\\r\\nSocrates\\r\\nIt is difficult to describe someone’s mental pain unless you have walked in their shoes, and even then it is subjective. When all you fear is living, death is a human blessing.\\r\\nThis inquiry addresses the suicide danger in response to the delayed onset of antidepressants. In addition, to review ketamine as an onset medication for mood disorder’s such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).\\r\\nMajor Depressive Disorder has become the most common mental health disorder in the United States, and suicide is a national epidemic which needs immediate attention. It was reported that in the past year over 16 million adults had at least one major depressive episode (NAMI, 2018). In addition, suicides have also risen dramatically. Just under 45,000 Americans die by suicide each year (American Foundation of Suicide Statistics, 2016). The suicide rates continue to rise (24% from 1999–2014) along with suicide attempts and ideations. The most common reason behind suicides, suicide ideations, and suicide attempts is severe depression. It is safe to say that many of us know someone who committed suicide. It is apprehensible to think that a friend, family member, and even a popular celebrity would take their own life but it increasingly happens every day. It is difficult to describe someone’s mental pain unless you have walked in their shoes, and even then it is subjective.\\r\\nMajor Depressive Disorder is a painful slow burn, which leaves lasting and continuing scars. You are defenseless against the scalding pain of fear, and hopelessness. The need to remove the intolerable mental pain, if only for a short time, is the plan.\\r\\nTo respond to suicidal thoughts due to depression and other emergent mental health issues there needs to be more than the common treatment using antidepressants and therapy. The typically used antidepressants do not provide immediate relief, leaving a gap of several weeks before there is an effect, and, there lays the problem. The delayed onset of the currently used antidepressants is the danger-zone and a likely gateway to suicide.\\r\\nAntidepressant medications were first discovered in the 1950’s, which included MAOI’s and TCI’s. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) were first discovered and marketed in 1987 and have remained popular because of their success in raising mood with fewer side effects. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors are the most widely used antidepressants and despite the popularity, one major downside remains the same; the delayed onset of medication relief. People who begin antidepressant treatment must face a grueling wait of several weeks before they find out whether or not the drug will work for them, and if it does not they start over with a new medication. Being in that bowel of hell for another round of possible medication relief is cruel. This delayed onset period is a catalytic agent to suicide ideation and suicide attempts.\\r\\nAccording to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) (2017) Major Depressive Disorder is the leading cause of suicides and often co-occurs with other diseases and/or disorders. Key symptoms include diminished interest in all or almost all activities, feelings of hopelessness, guilt, and worthlessness. These symptoms are strongly correlated with thoughts of death, a plan for suicide, or suicide attempt (SAMHSA, 2017). Today antidepressants prescribed for depression have greatly improved but still carry a life and death effect due to the delayed onset.\\r\\nAccording to a National survey done in 2016, 2.8 million people thought seriously about ending their life (SAMHSA, 2017). It was estimated that 31 million adults age 18 and over received mental health services in 2016, but still suicide rates continue to rise. There are several reasons why suicide rates have dramatically increased in the past 20 years but one constant supporter of suicide is the delayed onset of antidepressants. Most antidepressant medications and/or psychotherapy work quite well for those who make it through the delayed onset period. Even for those who do it is a journey of hell. There needs to be immediate relief. If we are unable to move forward in treatment methods then maybe we should look back.\\r\\nIn the mid 1960’s Ketamine was introduced in clinical practice as an anesthetic drug due to its ability to provide an effective sedation with few side effects (Li and Vlisides, 2016). Ketamine remains well-established and unchallenged in its role as an anesthetic. Kurdi, Theerth, and Deva (2014) reviewed the current useful applications of ketamine based on scientific evidence and found the use of ketamine extends beyond the field of anesthesia into pain, palliative care, intensive care, procedural sedation, electroconvulsive therapy, and post-operative depression. Currently, ketamine tends to be used more for minor procedures. However, it has recently shown promising results in treating severe depression.\\r\\nIn 2015, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) provided an updated report on the use of ketamine. The review included a large volume of research done in the last few years and found ketamine has the potential to be the new generation of antidepressants. They also revealed that the mechanism of ketamine is completely independent of other medications. One can have immediate relief and in addition begin an antidepressant for long-term relief. The Committee also acknowledged the use of ketamine for emergency situations where there is a risk of suicide (WHO, 2015). This begs the question of why ketamine is rarely in clinical practiced and in emergency situations such as suicide ideation or suicide attempts.\\r\\nKetamine’s lack of clinical trials seems to be a significant factor for its minimal usage. Ketamine can produce dose dependent psychological manifestations like emergent reactions, dreams, hallucinations and long-term psychotomimetic affects but these affects tend to be short-term (60 to 90 minutes) (Kurdi, Theerth, & Deva, 2014). Addiction seems to be another concern but under medical supervision ketamine has been used for sedation for decades and there is very little evidence to suggest that ketamine is addictive. Ketamine is also a safer choice for emergency situations in comparison to clozapine, benzodiazepine, and mood stabilizers. Clinical trials done by Wan et al. (2015) reported low dose ketamine is safe and well tolerated in depressed patients.\\r\\nIt is hoped that this enquiry puts a target on what needs to be done for those who suffer from suicide ideations, suicide attempts, and antidepressants delayed onset.

       " {'title': 'Atom arrays emerge as a surprise candidate for quantum computing',\n",
       "  'body': 'The long-awaited next breakthrough in computing is expected to come from so-called quantum computers, which will use quantum phenomena to lead to faster processing and radically improved data storage. Now, a physics graduate at Havard University has assembled a remarkable and unique system which may lead to the breakthrough quantum-computing has been waiting for.\\r\\nWhat may be most extraordinary about the system that Harry Levine and his team, led by Mikhail Lukin, has built in his small basement lab at the University is that there are no processor chips involved. Levine’s computer is powered by 51 rubidium atoms stored in a glass cell. These atoms are lined up single file by a laser split into 51beams.\\r\\nThe atoms are slowed until almost motionless by further lasers, whilst another set of lasers allows the user to encourage the atoms to interact. It is from these interactions that calculations can be performed.\\r\\nThe advantage a quantum computer confers is the ability of a quantum system to be in a superposition of states. This means that whereas a normal ‘bit’ can only have two possible states-0 or 1- a qubit can encode for ones and zeroes simultaneously in a superposition of states.\\r\\nIf scaled up, this set-up should vastly outperform traditional computers.\\r\\nEven amongst quantum computers, this set-up is quite remarkable. Most qubits that have been explored thus far have been built on silicon, superconducting wire, and semiconductor structures known as quantum dots. This work builds upon recent research using neutral atoms to form qubits.\\r\\nNeutral atoms have previously been believed to be poor choices for qubits due to their lack of an electrical charge and therefore don’t interact with other atoms easily. Physicists can overcome this difficulty by using specifically timed laser bursts to excite an atom’s outermost electron and move it from the atomic nucleus, into what is called a ‘Rydberg state.’ This has the effect of massively increasing the atom’s size.\\r\\nIn this Rydberg state, the atom behaves more like an ion, an atom with electrons stripped from it meaning that they are more likely to interact electromagnetically with neighbouring atoms. The interaction has the overall effect of preventing these neighbouring atoms from entering a Rydberg state themselves.\\r\\nThis confers an entangled state on the atoms, the state that is required to perform quantum calculations. A measurement on either atom collapses the superposition created by one atom being in the Rydberg state and the other not.\\r\\nThe advantage conferred by neutral atoms is that they are all identical, they can be packed into a much tighter space than silicon-based qubits and also do not need to be held at super-cold temperatures as superconducting qubits have to. Also, because neutral atoms are less likely to interact it means that they are less likely to interfere with each other and lose the stored quantum information.\\r\\nThus neutral atoms offer the advantage of scalability and a better overall performance.\\r\\nLukin’s work was published in the latest edition of the journal\\r\\nPhysical Review Letters\\r\\ndemonstrated the ability to programme a two-Rubinium logic gate with a\\r\\n97% accuracy.\\r\\nThis means the Rydberg method of qubit creation is close to the fidelity of superconducting qubits, which currently stands at 99%.\\r\\nIn addition to this, another piece of research published around the same time has added support to the versatility of Rydberg qubits.\\r\\nA team of French researchers published a\\r\\nstudy\\r\\nin the September edition of\\r\\nNature\\r\\nin which they were able to demonstrate remarkable control over a 3D array 72 neutral atoms. They were able to densely pack the atoms in a way that cannot be done with ions as they latter repeal each other due to their alike charge.\\r\\nWhilst Levine is positive that the system he has helped create will benefit the telecommunications industry, others are less convinced.\\r\\n“Compared with other qubits, neutral atoms tend not to stay put,” Varun Vaidya, a physicist at Xanadu, a quantum computing company, told\\r\\nScience.\\r\\nThis means that systems using neutral atoms may not be suitable for performing longer tasks as their stability is lacking.\\r\\nThere is no question that there is still a multitude of questions remaining regarding the potential of quantum computing and how to deliver the best qubit. Rydberg systems may well deliver the required answers.\\r\\nOriginally published at\\r\\nsciscomedia.co.uk\\r\\non September 29, 2018.',\n",

Both of these were uploaded on September 21st.\\r\\nIf these dates and numbers were a bit more planned out, you would think they are counting down to the release date of C5 on Wayne‘s birthday this Thursday (September 27th), which would be perfect for him to drop at midnight on the Friday as this is the day when new albums are usually released.\\r\\nThe numbers are all related to each sports athlete (mainly their jersey numbers), so I guess we will have to wait and see what happens, but if Weezy‘s good friend Chris Paul shares the “V” promo image on his Instagram page soon with a caption saying “#3” then it will certainly get interesting! What do you think the numbers mean?\\r\\nIn the past nine months, Jay Z and Beyonce, J. Cole, Drake, Cardi B, Kanye West, Nas and Nicki Minaj have each graced fans with a plethora of music to sift through. But listeners, streaming services and Billboard charts may also need to make room for an album from the self-proclaimed “greatest rapper alive” before the year’s end.\\r\\nPossible artwork for Lil Wayne’s Tha Carter V recently surfaced, hinting that the release date for the long-awaited album is quickly approaching. A new album couldn’t come at a better time for the 35-year-old rapper, as the past year has yielded him a handful of accomplishments. Wayne secured a spot on the 2018 Cash Kings list, pulling in $18 million\\u200a—\\u200ahis highest earnings since 2014; his mentees, Drake and Nicki Minaj, both recently released albums that earned platinum and gold status, respectively; and, he settled the years-long legal battle with Cash Money Records and Universal Music Group, for an undisclosed sum, in June.\\r\\nWayne also regained control over his Young Money imprint (Cash Money previously held 51%). Tha Carter V will be the first album released under Wayne’s reign, but the three-year, $51 million suit filed against Birdman and Cash Money in 2015 forced him to take a closer look at his books and his relationships.\\r\\nAfter a string of delays and legal issues, Lil Wayne’s long awaited album Tha Carter V is here. The Young Money founder officially announced the project’s release date earlier this week, explaining that its arrival coincides with his 36th birthday.\\r\\nThe project features XXXTENTACION, Nicki Minaj, Travis Scott, Kendrick Lamar, Snoop Dogg, Ashanti, Mack Maine, Nivea, Reginae Carter, and Sosamann. It runs 23 tracks, totaling one hour and 23 minutes. Production is handled by Ben Billions, Swizz Beatz, Infamous, Johnny Yukon, and more.\\r\\nTha Carter V had a long and rocky road to release, dating back to Wayne’s initial announcement in 2012 when he revealed plans to release it the following year. After several pushbacks, Wayne claimed in December 2014 that Birdman was forcing him to delay the project again. Wayne then filed a $51 million lawsuit in January 2015 against Birdman and Cash Money over unpaid royalties, holding onto the purportedly completed album as a bargaining chip over the next few years. In 2016, former pharmaceutical company CEO Martin Shkreli claimed to have purchased the unreleased album from an unknown seller. It remained among $7.36 million worth of assets that Shkreli was ordered to forfeit in March as a result of his security fraud convictions.\\r\\nIn June 2018, Wayne and Birdman finally came to reported $10 million settlement that ended the legal battle. As detailed in a recent Billboard cover story, each side reportedly retained their stakes in previous Young Money deals, but Wayne was apparently made whole. He now has full ownership of Young Money, with the imprint’s distribution deal with Republic remaining in place. As such, Tha Carter V is Wayne’s first project not released on Cash Money.',\n",

Want als de natuur heerlijk zijn gang heeft mogen gaan, en het een prachtig oerwoud is waarin allerlei beestjes kunnen leven, dan beginnen mensen te zuchten “Wat lelijk zeg”. “Waarom laten ze dat toch groeien?”. En dan maken we de boel weer dood door het kort te wieken. Want dat is ‘mooi’.\\r\\nHetzelfde is nu gaande aan de Zwaanstraat. Daar is een ‘project’, zoals wij mensen dat noemen, gestart. De afgelopen tijd is de autoweg weggehaald en is er een mooi breed fietspad gekomen. (Prima! Weg met die auto\\xa0:) )\\r\\nIk ga soms weleens een klein en (toegegeven) langzaam stukje joggen langs dat fietspad. En dan zie ik de konijntjes scharrelen. En soms zie ik een bijtje op een bloem neerstrijken. Tja, ik ga langzaam, dan zie je dat soort dingen. En de vogels scharrelen rond op zoek naar een insect of twee.\\r\\nMaar helaas hield het project niet op bij het aanleggen van dat fietspad. Nee, want het project heet De Groene Corridor.\\r\\nDus er moet Groen komen. Met hoofdletter G.\\r\\nDus, wat doen we met z’n allen? We rukken al het gras eruit. En dat boompje waar de konijntjes zich achter verscholen? Weghalen! En die plek waar de vogels naar insecten zochten? Dat ploegen we ook om. We maken het helemaal steriel, op een rij bomen na. Daar gooien we vers zand op. En dan planten we iets ‘moois’. Ik zie het al voor me. Er komt vast een prachtige rij graszoden in. De diversiteit van bloemen die er stond, die is weg. Dat gaan we vervangen door één soort, zeker? Of twee, op z’n hoogst. Geen ‘onkruid’ meer, nee bah. Het moet ‘mooi groen’. En met enige regelmaat gaan we alles wat er voorzichtig is komen leven verstoren door het te ‘onderhouden’. Weg konijntjes. In een paar jaar tijd hebben we ze teruggedrongen tot het Philips de Jonghpark en het parkje aan de Groenewoudseweg.\\r\\nWant ‘groen’, dat is kennelijk iets anders dan ‘natuur’.\\r\\nStop met al dat ge-’groen’. Wat wij moeten doen is zeggen “Dit stuk verklaren we tot\\r\\nvrije natuur\\r\\n”. En er dan\\r\\nmet onze poten vanaf blijven\\r\\n.\\r\\nZoals die prachtige overwoekerde rotonde op de kruising Halvemaanstraat-Zwaanstraat. Daar zie ik de konijntjes weleens uit hupsen. Prachtig toch? Niet maaien alsjeblieft.',\n",

       "  'body': 'If you’re into crypto, you’re most likely using Telegram, the cloud based world’s fastest messaging app. Often used as one of the eligibility criteria for various giveaways such as airdrops, which consequently increases the number of “followers”, it has also become the easiest way for companies to interact with members. Claimed to be the most secure messaging app on the market, this lead to a wide use range of Telegram for ICOs, including but not limited to, news channel, voting channel and obviously direct contact between users and the companies themselves. This method has proven to be a great niche for any project caring to build a serious customer experience and loyalty, prior and post to the launch of their product.\\r\\nIn the ICO world, users can be anyone from bounty hunters to potential investors, to curious followers and to even industry rival spies. Regardless of their motivation, the team’s response should be available and transparent.\\r\\nInvestors should do their due diligence of ICOs when making a decision. It’s not an easy task and one way to do that (but shouldn’t be the only way) is by joining the project’s Telegram group where questions can be asked and concerns addressed. It is also the landing point when an issue has risen and users need help.\\r\\nCompanies set up a team of admins as the first point of contact in Telegram, to answer to queries and assist those in need. This customer service is obviously a great way to start a connection and interact with those interested in their project. Furthermore, this can also evolve into a customer care. Customer care is about how well members are taken care of by listening to their issues and finding the right solution. This may happen on the main channel but also via direct message (DM), as one of the features offered by Telegram. The admin will assist a member to the best of his/her ability and if the answer isn’t at hand, he/she will seek for the solution from the team then communicate it back. Trouble-shooting on a one-to-one basis leaves the user with a personal satisfaction of being attended, listened to and valued as an individual. If well conducted, that approach can be the base of a long-term relationship.\\r\\nHowever, if courtesy is generally flowing, it can at times bring its opposite. There will always be unhappy members for a variety of reasons, some justified, some not. And if not handled in a professional manner, this could rapidly escalate to some type of fud. How the team respond can make the difference between a user who feels satisfied with the answer provided and one that wows never to criticise the project again.\\r\\nIn some rare projects, CEOs have also been dealing directly to make sure no one is left behind. This type of open-minded thinking and friendliness throws an extra layer that brings the community closer to the founders, not to mention the resounding feeling of being part of the project they strongly believe in. Having the executive team interacting with members on a regular basis makes a huge difference and impact on not just about creating a bond but also a core of loyal followers. Unfortunately, rare are the projects where CEOs and even their advisors, interact with users due to their hectic schedules; but if you do find one, then you know that the community being built around their project matters to them.\\r\\nA well-informed and interactive community of followers is necessary for any project’s growth and for that reason, companies will always be grateful for having them by their side.\\r\\nThere are of course other ways to address the team such as via email to customer support or through other social media medium; but for a quicker response, Telegram has all the features users want and need in this time and age of technology.\\r\\nThe journey of a member’s interaction with the entire team (admins and executives) is the perfect proactive surfing wave for delivering the best customer experience. It’s an entire operation that requires an abondance of patience, care and devotion, a key to success.\\r\\nA good customer experience is the result of a reactive customer service and customer care. It should be at the heart of everything a company does to achieve a satisfied customer base that is loyal to the project and that will return for more. And if cleverly organised, Telegram is the perfect boosting tool!',\n",

       "  'body': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6Ng298HXcM\\r\\nAs expected, Thursday’s testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett Kavanaugh left room for doubt regarding the alleged sexual assault. Unless the FBI investigation changes things, we have a classic He Said, She Said; and people of good conscience are free to believe whichever witness they choose. But Judge Kavanaugh’s angry rant as he addressed the committee brings up an entirely different, overwhelmingly important reason he is not fit to be any kind of Federal Judge, and unquestionably not a Justice on the highest court of our land. He claims to believe the GOP’s latest conspiracy theory that Dr. Ford’s accusation was cooked up at the last minute by Democrats as a strategy to shoot down his nomination.\\r\\nWhy is that such a deal breaker? There is zero evidence to support the notion. Only\\r\\ncrank magnetism\\r\\nwould convince someone such a claim is valid in the absence of any substantive evidence supporting it. Only the rankest of partisan ideologues would dismiss as absurd the notion that people of good faith might believe Dr. Ford on the weight of her gut-wrenching testimony.\\r\\nIn fact, Kavanaugh’s “Dem Hit Job” conspiracy theory is contradicted by a substantial body of evidence he’s willing to reject because it fails to support his confirmation bias. Judge Neil Gorsuch went to the same prep school in his high school years. He attended at nearly the same time. His nomination went right through the Judicial Committee without any “Dem Hit Job.” It’s worth noting that at his hearing, the Democrats were still fuming over GOP obstruction of Obama’s legitimate nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, who Republicans refused even to give a hearing. If ever they were going to pull a sham to obstruct a nomination, why didn’t they do it then? In fact, we have not seen such a Kabuki theater since Clarence Thomas’ nomination, and in it, there was no sham. Democrats legitimately believed Thomas’ law clerk, Anita Hill, when she came forward with sexual harassment claims.\\r\\nAlso, one must wonder, if Dr. Ford’s claims were recently fabricated by Democrats, how they managed to have her tell her husband of the attack and its effect on her way back in 2002. Are we to believe Senator Feinstein is psychic, or does she possess a working crystal ball?\\r\\nOne thing is clear. Trump and his new nominee are birds of a feather when it comes to crank magnetism. Trump’s so far into conspiracy lore he’s approaching the fatal end-stage;\\r\\nfractal wrongness\\r\\n. Let us hope the FBI turns up facts that derail this nomination before we seat a man on the Supreme Court who may come to be wrong more often than a stopped clock.\\r\\nhttps://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/05/29/nyts_maggie_haberman_trump_is_legitimizing_conspiracy_theores.html',\n",

Con 21 años estaba en la flor de la vida. Ya desde pequeñita siempre había recibido elogios de toda su familia, era la niña bonita. Conoció a Marcelo a través de un amigo de clase de la universidad. Marcelo era italo- argentino y con 34 años había viajado por medio mundo. Había sido profesor de surf, recepcionista de un hostal de playa y camarero por las noches en diferentes pubs. Ahora decía ser fotógrafo porque desde hacía unos años había descubierto el poder que ejercía una buena cámara y los resultados de ésta sobre cualquier chica que necesitara la respuesta a una pregunta que unos dibujos animados le habían metido en la cabeza cuando era niña: “Espejito, espejito mágico, quién es la más hermosa del reino?” Era una víctima más para Marcelo, un cromo más que llenaría su álbum de sonrisas vacías de contenido. Graciela estaba radiante y feliz. Lucía un mini bikini negro y realizaba todas las poses que Marcelo le ordenaba. Y él, contento de realizar una muesca más en su revólver de fetichismo amoral. Graciela por su parte solo pensaba en cuándo podría subir esas fotos tan divinas a su instagram. Ella iba a los restaurantes de moda, los centros de belleza más top de su ciudad, iba al gym perfectamente conjuntada para la ocasión y siempre tenía una expresión, facial y corporal, para sus miles de seguidores a los que nunca había conocido en persona. Esos mismos que al igual que Marcelo, recurrían al onanismo tecnológico como quien se come un trozo de pizza mientras buscan algo que ver entre las miles de opciones que les daba su Smart Tv. Y así, sin saber ninguno de los dos cómo se escribe Schopenhauer, pasaron la mañana de aquel sábado juntos. Víctima y verdugo de un mismo orden mundial que había asesinado a un fenómeno llamado introspección, aquello que les podría haber llevado al conocimiento esencial del yo. O quizás eso mismo, su nueva adicción a lo superficial, les estaba salvando de una vida mísera que solo invita al suicidio, puesto que la mirases por donde la mirases, estaba llena de agujeros, roída y podrida como la madera enmohecida que yace bajo tierra del lugar en donde acabamos todos, un puto cementerio.',\n",

Though, one is related to me\\u200a—\\u200aand I had half a mind to ask her for a list of names.

It’s doubtful you’ll change their mind about any of it, especially if you go about doing so through shouting and calling them names. You are not Thomas Jefferson, your truths are not self evident.\\r\\nWe need to get better at hearing the other side out, regardless of how much we may disagree with them. There’s nothing wrong with disagreeing with someone or with a healthy debate\\u200a—\\u200athe problem is we see less and less of them lately. We’ve gotten entirely too self righteous for our own good.\\r\\nHere’s another unpopular opinion, just because you think someone did something, doesn’t make them guilty.

В итоге «партнеров-звезд», которые продают и зарабатывают немного, менеджеры тратят много времени на рутинную работу с партнерами, а главный канал продаж страдает.\\r\\nРешение:\\r\\nанализ партнерской программы и исправление неработающих эпизодов.\\r\\nЧто сделали:\\r\\nинтервью с партнерами, анализ партнерок конкурентов и составление\\r\\nTotal Product Concept\\r\\n, составление\\r\\nCustomer Journey Map\\r\\nпартнера, разработка новых условий партнерской программы, создание курсов для обучения партнеров, разработка новой партнерской страницы.\\r\\nСроки и время завершения:\\r\\n3 месяца. Октябрь 2017.\\r\\nДля того, чтобы верифицировать отправную точку и понять с чем нам придется работать\\u200a—\\u200aпровели серию интервью с действующими партнерами, которые находятся на разных этапах отношений с компанией: новички, успешно продают, почему-то не продают и бывшие партнеры. Выяснили, какие барьеры у них есть во взаимодействии с компанией.\\r\\nПараллельно изучаем конкурентов. Основная задача понять условия партнерских программ конкурентов и то, как устроено их взаимодействие с партнерами. Для этого представляемся потенциальным партнером и пытаемся заключить партнерский договор со всеми производителями онлайн-касс. Оцениваем вложения, сколько партнер получает с продажи оборудования, откуда партнеру брать клиентов условия обучения и т.д.\\r\\nВ «Меркате» изначально все партнеры разделены на юридических лиц (это ЦТО, IT-интеграторы и другие компании из смежных к кассовой теме сфер) и физические лиц\\u200a—\\u200aэто люди, которые самостоятельно продают кассы. Мы определили, что работу начнем с компаний, а уже после займемся физ. лицами. Компаний среди партнеров количественно больше и денег в абсолютных величинах они приносят больше.\\r\\nНачали составлять CJM. Выделили основные этапы, через которые проходит партнер при взаимодействии с нами, начиная от первого контакта с рекламным сообщением, заканчивая аудитом его работы. Отразили на CJM барьеры и способы борьбы с ними.\\r\\nОпределив барьеры и поняв, что мы хотим получить от Партнерской программы\\u200a—\\u200aмы описали её полные условия.\\r\\nПри создании новых условий партнерской программы мы отталкивались от текущих барьеров, анализа конкурентов и необходимости как можно сильнее автоматизировать процесс работы с партнерами.\\r\\nОдним из требований к партнерской программе было на самых ранних этапах определять и отсекать людей, которые по какой-то причине не дойдут до заключения партнерского договора и продаж. Для этого мы предусмотрели прескоринг и перенесли обучение на более ранний этап\\u200a—\\u200aэто значительная временная инвестиция и человек, который не заинтересован просто не захочет тратить свое время.\\r\\nВ условиях партнерской программы мы предусматриваем разные возможности для начала партнерских отношений\\r\\nОтдали финансовому директору на утверждение. После того, как все формальности улажены\\u200a—\\u200aначинаем работу по внедрения изменений.\\r\\nДекомпозировали требования к партнерской программе до конкретных задач. Часть задач отдали на реализацию партнерскому отделу, другую часть взяли на себя.\\r\\nЭпизод 5.1. Внедрение системы обучения\\r\\nОсновным барьером, который отмечали все без исключения респонденты и даже сами менеджеры\\u200a—\\u200aбыло то, что люди не понимают, что им делать после заключения договора.\\r\\nА именно:\\r\\nРешаем внедрить систему онлайн обучения. В основу обучения предлагаем заложить онлайн обучение SCORM формата + просмотр коротких видео о функционале и преимуществах «Меркаты» и прохождении после них тестов.\\r\\nКурсы формируем исходя из той информации, которая необходима определенному типу партнера для успешной работы. Например: партнеру, который только внедряет вовсе не обязательно знать тонкости продаж. И наоборот, партнер, который только продает не обязан погружать в тонкости настройки и внедрения.\\r\\nДобавляем в план ежемесячные вебинары, чтобы информировать партнеров об изменениях в партнерской программе.\\r\\nПартнерский отдел снимает обучающие видео видео, мы их монтируем, разделяем на части, добавляем методические материалы и заливаем на обучающие платформу. Пишем тесты, которые партнер будет проходить в конце обучения.\\r\\nПараллельно записываем скринкасты об особенностях работы на партнерском портале, которые тоже пойдут на обучающий портал.\\r\\nЗапускаем первых партнеров, собираем фидбек, смотрим как партнеры проходят узкое место.\\r\\nОформляем сертификаты, которые партнер получит после прохождения обучения.\\r\\n5.2 Разработка страницы с новыми условиями Партнерской программы:\\r\\nГлавная задача партнерского лендинга\\u200a—\\u200aпознакомить потенциальных партнеров с условиями партнерской программы и опять же отсечь тех, кто не дойдет до начала продаж.\\r\\nДелаем прототип, отдаем в дизайн, верстаем и вешаем на домен. Это легко, когда у тебя есть описанные условия и ты понимаешь, что хочешь донести до будущих партнеров.\\r\\n5.3 Кассы в рассрочку\\r\\nПока разрабатывали Партнерскую программу продолжали общаться с партнерами, собирая обратную связь.\\r\\nПартнеры жаловались, что их клиентам дорого прямо сейчас покупать онлайн-кассу, поэтому они постоянно это откладывают (тем более на момент реформирования партнерской программы сроки еще позволяли).\\r\\n«Это не дело»,\\u200a—\\u200aрешили мы и договорились с двумя банками о рассрочке на наши кассы.\\r\\nПосле всех договоренностей сделали еврофлаер с описанием преимущества кассы и условиями рассрочки, чтобы партнеры могли оставить его у клиента.\\r\\nПрезентуем партнерскую программу сотрудникам партнерского отдела: рассказываем, как было, что сделали и как с этим теперь жить.\\r\\nОформляем доступы к сервисам в отдельный файл, пишем инструкцию по работе на обучающем портале и отдаем руководителю партнерского отдела.',\n",

I failed in that responsibility and, as a result, we will never get back the life of Sutchi Hui. Words cannot adequately express how sorry I am for his death and for the loss to his family. I carry that sorrow with me every day.\\r\\nThis story is about what happened after the accident\\u200a—\\u200aand it’s a story that happens all too often: High-profile cases get tried not in courtrooms, but on TV and the internet. Media fans the flames, the public quickly passes judgment, and elected officials bend the system to secure political wins\\u200a—\\u200aat the expense of due process and fair outcomes.\\r\\nThe narrative is based on court transcripts, newspaper and online articles, television broadcasts, and extensive notes and journal entries I made in the months after the accident. To protect the privacy of others, I changed some names. All else is true to my memory of what happened.\\r\\nI am sharing this not for redemption or personal profit, but because this side of the story rarely gets told. To make sure our justice system treats all defendants fairly, we need to speak up when it doesn’t.\\r\\nI’m Chris Bucchere.\\r\\nAnd this is\\r\\nBikelash\\r\\n.\\r\\n7 March 2013–343 days since the accident\\r\\nT\\r\\nhe very next morning, I experienced a moment of déjà vu as almost the same cast of characters\\u200a—\\u200aTed, Julie, Fred, and now PI John Mason\\u200a—\\u200ahuddled with me in the Hall of Justice. Everyone sported a slightly different look\\u200a—\\u200asuits of slightly different colors, different shirts, different colored ties\\u200a—\\u200abut aside from that, everything felt just like it had the day before. I maintained a pretty high level of confidence that once we settled the existential debate over the traffic light\\u200a—\\u200aand once Judge Cheng acknowledged that traffic light\\u200a—\\u200ahe would find me not at fault in this accident and either outright dismiss the ridiculous charges based on false testimony, or, worst case, knock the charges down to a misdemeanor.\\r\\nMy confidence was shaken a bit when I realized we had a major problem on our hands: No media had turned out for day two of the PX\\u200a—\\u200ano antenna trucks, no camera crews, no microphones. Normally, I would have appreciated this, but today was the day our PI would present incontrovertible video evidence, and the media weren’t going to be here to see it. Ted would deliver an eloquent closing argument that would convince Judge Cheng to let me walk. But the media wouldn’t be there to hear that either, so they wouldn’t report on it, thereby missing the opportunity, for the first time, to tell the other side of this story.\\r\\nJulie and I gave a quick pep talk to Ted and asked him to slow down, way, way down.\\r\\nThe accident is complicated; everything in the video happens so fast, you’ve gotta walk the judge through this slowly, methodically; make sure it all sinks in\\r\\n, we begged. Ted took it well, even though he had at least fifteen years more relevant experience in these matters than anybody else in the huddle.\\r\\nAfter one delay and another, the bailiff finally called court into session. “All right. Are we ready for your first witness?” asked Judge Cheng.\\r\\n“We are, Your Honor. We call John Mason,” Ted said, but while echoes of the name still reverberated in the courtroom, Omid spoke up, sounding perturbed.\\r\\n“I\\r\\ndo\\r\\nwant to make a record that the first time I ever heard the name John Mason was seconds ago when Mr. Cassman called his witness,” he said.\\r\\n“That’s true,” Ted replied, as I suddenly remembered that Ted had agreed to call Omid with the name of our one and only witness. “I forgot to call him last night.”\\r\\n“All right,” said Judge Cheng, and, without further ado, the court swore in our private investigator.\\r\\n“Mr. Mason, how are you employed?” Ted asked.\\r\\n“I’m a private investigator,” John replied.\\r\\n“And are you licensed with the State of California?”\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n“Last night, did you go to the intersection of Castro Street and Market Street?”\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n“Where specifically did you go?”\\r\\n“I was standing beneath the sign for Twin Peaks Tavern, beneath and slightly to the right on the sidewalk.”\\r\\n“Do you know what corner of the street that is?”\\r\\n“Yeah. That’s where Castro meets 17th and just before it meets Market Street.”\\r\\n“Okay. So it’s the southeast corner?”\\r\\n“Objection. Leading,” interjected Omid.\\r\\nHe can object all he wants,\\r\\nI thought,\\r\\nbut nothing is going to stop Ted and John from proving the obvious.\\r\\n“Sustained,” said Judge Cheng.\\r\\n“So, do you know what corner?” asked Ted.\\r\\n“Yes. The compass direction would be the southeast corner,” John said calmly. He didn’t need Ted to ask leading questions; he already knew the obvious\\u200a—\\u200athe light in question was one of six that work in tandem to control traffic at Market and Castro. Ted wanted to make sure there couldn’t be even a shadow of doubt.\\r\\n“Of Market [and] Castro?” asked Ted.\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\nTed showed John a photograph (Defense Exhibit E) taken from under the Twin Peaks Tavern sign, just below where the 360-degree security camera was mounted. John perfunctorily identified the photo and the traffic light contained there. Everyone\\u200a—\\u200aeven Nathan Pollak, Mahoney, Omid, and maybe even his boss Sharon and her boss George\\u200a—\\u200aknew about the traffic light. But of course Mahoney, in his expert opinion, had tried to explain to the court how this traffic signal controlled traffic somewhere else other than the very intersection in which was located. This game of hide-the-traffic-light ended here.\\r\\n“Were you able to determine the direction of traffic that is controlled by that traffic signal?” asked Ted.\\r\\n“Yes. Northbound traffic on Castro,” said John, matter-of-factly.\\r\\n“So it controls the traffic that’s flowing from south to north on Castro, through the intersection at Market Street?” Ted asked, restating John’s testimony almost word for word.\\r\\n“Objection. Leading, misstates the testimony,” Omid spoke up, trying to derail a truth train that was very much still on track. Strangely, Judge Cheng cooperated.\\r\\n“Sustained as to leading,” the judge said.\\r\\n“So, I thought I was just repeating his testimony, Your Honor,” Ted said, sounding exasperated. “I’ll try again.”\\r\\n“So, what traffic flow does it control?”\\r\\n“Northbound traffic from Castro.”\\r\\n“And does it control it as northbound traffic at Castro approaches an intersection?”\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n“And what intersection is that?”\\r\\n“Market and Castro.”\\r\\n“Okay. So to be clear, the signal that’s depicted in Defense Exhibit E and that you saw last night controls northbound traffic on Castro Street as it approaches Market Street?”\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n“How were you able to determine that?”\\r\\n“By observation. When the light turned red, traffic moving in the northbound direction stopped, and the traffic on Market Street, after a brief pause, would pick up and move in an east or west direction.”\\r\\n“And what happened when the traffic signal depicted in Defense Exhibit E and that you saw last night turned green?”\\r\\n“Then traffic would begin to flow northbound and southbound on Castro.”\\r\\n“You noticed that when the traffic light you saw last night and is depicted in Defense Exhibit E turned green, that traffic on Castro Street flowed simultaneously both northbound and southbound?”\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n“Did you take a video of the scene?”\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\nDefendant’s Exhibit F, a thumb drive containing a video, was brought before the court. “Your Honor, we have the video. We were rushed last night so it’s actually on a USB drive,” Ted said.\\r\\n“Also, for the record,” Omid said, “Mr. Cassman first told me about this video about ninety seconds before the Court came out, didn’t tell me about this last night. When we had a conference at sidebar, there was no mention that this video would be taking place.” Omid sounded like someone had taken away his candy. “I just want to make that record,” he added\\u200a—\\u200aunnecessarily, because the stenographer had already done so.\\r\\n“All right,” said Judge Cheng, this time more sternly than the last. “It’s noted for the record. You may proceed.”\\r\\n“And, Your Honor, I also offered to give him five minutes to look at it and he said, no, this morning,” said Ted.\\r\\nI suspected that Omid refused just so that he could make this on-the-record objection to distract the court from the important part: the contents of the video that proved the relevance of the traffic signal.\\r\\n“So playing for you what’s been marked as Defense Exhibit F, do you see a still photograph that’s up on the screen?” Ted asked.\\r\\n“Yes.” John Mason responded.\\r\\n“And can you tell us what that depicts?”\\r\\nTed and John continued their back-and-forth until what was was already obvious became abundantly clear. The traffic signal in the intersection controlled traffic in the intersection.\\r\\nYou can’t make this stuff up\\r\\n!\\r\\nAs the court called for a cross-examination, I wondered what on earth Omid was going to ask John.\\r\\nWhat sort of stunt will he try to pull? Will he ask about John being on Ted’s (or, ultimately, my) payroll? Will he insist that his expert somehow knows more than ours? Or will he ask something so outlandish that I can’t even imagine what it might be?\\r\\nI feared the worst.\\r\\n“Please,” Omid said to John, sounding disgusted. “You can take a seat.”\\r\\n“The video was taken last night, correct?” Omid asked.\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n“Not March 29th of last year, correct?”\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n“Not at any point in the entire year of 2012, correct?”\\r\\n“Correct.”\\r\\n“It was taken conservatively eleven months after the date of the incident; is that correct?”\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\nSo\\r\\nwhat’s he gonna do\\u200a—\\u200asay that plate tectonics moved the traffic light to some other part of the city in the past eleven months?\\r\\nNothing was beyond absurdity with these people. Thankfully, Omid moved on to a more predictable line of questioning.\\r\\n“You’ve never been certified as an accident reconstruction expert, have you?”\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n“You don’t have extensive training in accident reconstruction, do you?”\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n“Do you have training in traffic, specifically investigation?”\\r\\n“No.” Omid had asked the same question three times, but before I had time to get mad, he moved on.\\r\\n“When you did this\\r\\nlittle\\r\\nvideo, was Mr. Cassman there with you?” Omid shook his finger at Ted, Julie, and me, using “little” in the most pejorative way possible.\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n“Objection to the question, Your Honor. Argumentative,” said Ted. The question wasn’t even really that argumentative, but Omid’s tone tipped the scales.\\r\\n“Overruled,” said the judge.\\r\\n“Mr. Cassman was with you?” Omid said, like it was some kind of accusation, not a question.\\r\\n“Yes,” said John.\\r\\n“And Mr. Cassman was having a conversation with you?”\\r\\n“Not while I was taking the video.”\\r\\n“Okay. Before the video was taken, you guys were discussing this case, correct?\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n“He was telling you what he wanted you to do, correct?”\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n“He was telling you what he wanted you to specifically look for, right?”\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n“And because he told you that, then you made a point to look for certain things, correct?”\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n“And that the light that’s depicted I think in People’s E\\u200a—\\u200a”\\r\\n“Defense Exhibit E,” Ted interjected.\\r\\n“Defense E, that controls northbound traffic on Castro Street, correct?” asked Omid.\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n“In addition to Mr. Cassman being with you, who else was with you?”\\r\\n“Julie Salamon.”\\r\\n“So, was she also having conversations with you before the video was taken about this case?”\\r\\n“Perhaps, but probably to a lesser degree than Ted.”\\r\\n“It’s fair to say that both of them were having conversations with you specifically about what they wanted you to look for, right?”\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n“I have nothing further.”\\r\\n“Any redirect?” asked Judge Cheng.\\r\\n“Nothing, Your Honor,” said Ted.\\r\\nOmid had steered clear of the important assertion that John Mason made about the traffic light by nibbling around the edges\\u200a—\\u200aMason’s qualifications, the passage of time between the accident and the video he took, and that my attorneys had instructed him to do what he had done at Market and Castro the previous night. John held up pretty well. There were scant few people in the courtroom that day\\u200a—\\u200anothing like the day before\\u200a—\\u200ayet I didn’t think anyone doubted that the traffic light Mahoney tried to deny out of existence fired in exact sequence with the same light the DA was accusing me of running.\\r\\nAs far as I could tell, the phase of calling witnesses had ended, and the closing arguments were about to begin. Based on the rules of engagement, Ted’s closing argument came first. I sat up in my chair and inched forward, the sweat on my back causing my shirt and sport coat to stick to the back of the seat.\\r\\nThis is it,\\r\\nI thought.\\r\\nThe crazy train stops here.\\r\\n7 March 2013–343 days since the accident\\r\\nAs\\r\\nwe closed in on the one-year anniversary of the fateful accident, the world had heard nothing but the DA’s and the police’s side of the story\\u200a—\\u200aalong with an even more outrageous version that the media had simply willed into existence. With each passing moment, this story grew more and more disconnected from the events that actually took place on March 29.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the story also became more predictable: I rode my bike recklessly\\u200a—\\u200aspeeding through three red lights and a stop sign, trying to set a new land speed record on Strava\\u200a—\\u200athen raced home to brag about it and make a YouTube video weighing the value of the deceased’s life against a bike helmet\\u200a—\\u200aor other such nonsense. Until now, that was the prevailing storyline that had dominated the local, national, and international press, and I could do nothing to stop it. Not unless I wanted to lose the best criminal defense attorney in the Bay Area.\\r\\nOutside of that attorney and maybe a dozen other people, no one even knew about the existence of any other story. But now, finally, Ted would stand at the podium and lay all of his cards on the table. In a few moments, he would explain how the witnesses Wen-chih Yu and Angelo Cilia in the crosswalk, “expert” Michael Mahoney, and witness Nathan Pollak\\u200a—\\u200athe man behind the lies that enabled the DA to bring felony charges in the first place\\u200a—\\u200awere all clearly and directly contradicted by the video, an incontrovertible piece of evidence that the prosecution themselves obtained and admitted into evidence to use\\r\\nagainst\\r\\nme.\\r\\nBefore John Mason had even cleared the well, the court had already started making sure that all the evidence was moved in and dealing with other procedural matters. What had been a slow and painful process suddenly started moving very quickly. I blinked\\u200a—\\u200aor so it seemed\\u200a—\\u200aand Ted had already begun his closing argument.\\r\\n“Your Honor, I’m going to be playing the video a lot because I think it’s very important for the Court. I’m going to be asking the Court to make findings. I know it’s unusual but I think it’s more than merited in this case given the nature of the evidence that was presented from the prosecution’s expert.\\r\\n“And I’m hopeful that the Court’s going to be able to see it but if not, I’m going to ask two things. Could we take a few minutes to move our table\\u200a—\\u200ahopefully a little closer, so that the image will be sharper?”\\r\\n“Well, I don’t have a problem with your using the video to illustrate your argument,” said Judge Cheng. “In terms of making factual findings, I’m not sure that’s appropriate. It’s a limited task here, but if it will assist your argument, go ahead and play it. If I have difficulty seeing what you’re mentioning, then I’ll let you know.” Again, the judge gave the unmistakable impression that he couldn’t care less about what was happening in his courtroom.\\r\\nI found this baffling, because Ted was about to\\r\\ndisprove\\r\\nthe prosecution’s entire case. Trying to get the court to make findings could be a long shot, but it was worth a try. We all felt like we deserved a little sympathy after hearing nothing but the litany of lies the DA’s office had fed to the media and put forth in the courtroom the day before.\\r\\n“Okay. I’m just going to move the table over a little bit to try to make the image sharper,” said Ted.\\r\\n“That’s fine,” said the judge.\\r\\n“Judge Cheng,” Ted continued, “I’ve been doing this for thirty years now. And in that experience, vehicular manslaughter cases are well among the very saddest that I see come into the criminal justice system. And I’m sure you’ve had experience with them, too. They have horrendous consequences for the family, for the deceased, obviously, for those who care and loved him. The consequences are the same as murder, the same as murder, and we understand that. And our hearts go out to the family of Mr. Hui and I know that Chris’s heart goes out to the family.”\\r\\nAs Ted said those words, I thought about the Hui family, as I had done thousands of times before. How would it change their already profound loss if\\u200a—\\u200aafter all the horrible things they read and watched ostensibly about me\\u200a—\\u200aI was found not to be at fault in the accident?\\r\\nWith all the time, money, and effort I had poured into defending myself from these baseless allegations, it was easy to forget something really important: A man died here. If only we could focus on that tragic loss, on making sure the family got compensated through insurance, and perhaps on making Market and Castro and other big, dangerous intersections safer for all parties who want and need to use them.\\r\\nBut these ideas would have to wait for after my exoneration. Ted continued with his closing argument.\\r\\n“But, on the other hand, the conduct that is in question is very dissimilar from that involved in a murder case. The conduct is so much less severe. And the man who’s accused of committing that conduct is just frankly a very good man with no prior contacts with the criminal justice system of any kind, and certainly that’s true here. That’s the emotional dichotomy that is presented in a case like this and, nevertheless, it requires a legal examination with a certain amount of detachment and that’s what we’re requesting of the Court today: to examine the facts closely, to consider the evidence, and to make a ruling that serves justice.\\r\\n“Has the prosecution presented sufficient evidence for a finding of probable cause that Mr. Bucchere was grossly negligent? The answer is no.\\r\\n“And I want to start by addressing the questions that the prosecution’s expert Mr. Mahoney addressed. I realize that Mr. Mahoney\\u200a—\\u200aand I want to emphasize to the Court\\u200a—\\u200aanswered them without having realized that the traffic signal that controls northbound traffic on Castro Street was right in front of him. There was no need to make assumptions about when the light turned red and when the walk signal became WALK for pedestrians. There was no need for him to infer from people’s actions in the crosswalk when the WALK signal turned on. There was no need for any speculation or assumption or inference of any kind. The evidence, objective evidence as he admitted on the stand once he saw that light, is that it turned red at 8:02:14\\u200a—\\u200aat 8:02:14 by the timer on the videotape.”\\r\\nTed walked over to the easel and wrote: “8:02:14 red light” in bold red letters.\\r\\n“So, we don’t need to assume anything. The Court has the video and we know for a fact when the light turned red. So the first question that Mr. Mahoney addressed: Was the light red when Mr. Bucchere entered the intersection? The facts establish the following. The traffic signal in the upper left-hand corner of the top screen of People’s Number Two controls traffic running northbound on Castro Street.\\r\\n“Your Honor, we’re starting the tape at 8:00:10. It’s now up to 8:00:11. Your Honor can see that the light in the upper left-hand corner of the upper screen of People’s Number Two is green and that traffic is flowing north on Castro Street. Your Honor can see that it turned yellow and red, that a car stops northbound on Castro Street and that traffic commences east-west on Market Street after a short delay. Your Honor sees that at about 8:01:45, the light turns green, traffic starts moving north on Castro Street, and also southbound on Castro Street in the upper left-hand corner.\\r\\n“And let’s stop it now.\\r\\n“So there is no doubt. I ask for a finding from the Court that the traffic signal in the upper left-hand corner of People’s Exhibit Number Two controls traffic flow for northbound and southbound on Castro Street.\\r\\n“Now, at 8:02:06, which is where we are now, the light is green. And as the Court can see, at 8:02:11, it turns yellow and at 8:02:14\\u200a—\\u200astop it\\u200a—\\u200aat 8:02:14, it turned red. Would the Court like me to replay that?”\\r\\n“No,” said Judge Cheng.\\r\\nWeird\\r\\n, I thought.\\r\\nThe expert Michael Mahoney and Nathan Pollak both had to get up and walk over to the video screen in order to see the “hidden” traffic signal, but Judge Cheng has no trouble seeing it at all. Either he has incredibly good vision or he doesn’t care that Ted is taking apart the prosecution’s entire case.\\r\\n“I want to continue to play it and ask the Court to focus on the upper right-hand portion of the screen, but before we do, I’ll note that pedestrians are clearly depicted in the crosswalk at 8:02:16. And I ask the Court please observe traffic westbound on Market Street. Stop.\\r\\n“Traffic westbound on Market Street commenced moving three or four seconds after that light turned red. That’s a critical point for the Court to consider. We had an expert who attempted to make assumptions based on pedestrian traffic in the crosswalk on Castro Street. However, he ignored the fact that there was traffic eastbound on Market Street that did not move until three to four seconds after the accident. There is only one explanation for that: The all red for three and a half seconds after the light turned red had not ceased until at least 8:02:17.5 and hence, the all red was in effect until that time and that’s why traffic\\u200a—\\u200ain rush hour traffic at 8:00 in the morning on a workday did not commence to move. That’s the only explanation.\\r\\n“We don’t need to speculate here based on what rush hour pedestrians who are trying to catch a MUNI bus, heading for the MUNI station across the street, are doing and why they’re doing it.”\\r\\nIn as many words, Ted said that eight pedestrians had grossly jumped into the crosswalk against a DON’T WALK symbol.\\r\\nNow we’re getting somewhere\\r\\n.\\r\\n“Now, what we do know from Mr. Mahoney is that at 8:02:14, Mr. Bucchere’s head was visible within the intersection on Market Street. I have the exhibit. May I bring it to Your Honor?”\\r\\n“Yes,” said Judge Cheng. I had half expected him to say, “No, don’t bother.”\\r\\n“May I point to it?” asked Ted. “I had Mr. Mahoney circle Mr. Bucchere’s head as he was proceeding through Market Street. At 8:02:14, the light controlling traffic northbound on Castro Street turned red and Mr. Bucchere was in the intersection. Mr. Mahoney’s expert opinion that the light was red for six and a half seconds before the point of impact is patently incorrect.\\r\\n“So, Your Honor, we have demonstrated beyond any doubt, reasonable or otherwise\\u200a—\\u200aand we have no burden\\u200a—\\u200abut we have demonstrated beyond any doubt that Mr. Bucchere did not run the red light, and that comes from the prosecution’s expert with his own eyes who missed the most important fact in the case: the traffic signal in the upper left-hand corner of People’s Number Two [the surveillance video from Twin Peaks Tavern].\\r\\n“I want to talk a minute about Nathan Pollak. I know that the Court’s not going to weigh credibility of witnesses, that’s not your job here, that’s not the role you play in these proceedings. I understand that. But you must weigh the evidence and you must consider what’s reasonable or even possible and what’s flatly contradicted.\\r\\n“In this case, putting aside his inappropriate and disrespectful demeanor and his willingness to lie apparently under oath when confronted with the fact that he was watching a video and first wanted to say no, putting aside that, People’s Number Two [the video] flatly contradicts his testimony and proves that it is false.\\r\\n“Julie, let’s roll the video. We’re at 8:02:14, Your Honor, and you see one vehicle in the upper left-hand corner approaching. Were you able to see that?”\\r\\n“Yes,” said the judge.\\r\\n“Okay. Great.\\r\\n“And then at 8:02:20, you see the bicycle go down in the upper left-hand corner? And at 8:02:25\\u200a—\\u200akeep going. 8:02:32, a second vehicle appears to approach the intersection southbound on Castro Street. 8:02:38, a third vehicle appears which\\u200a—\\u200astop it. Mr. Pollak identified that as his vehicle when he didn’t realize that it was thirty seconds after the accident. Keep going.\\r\\n“That vehicle that we just saw pull into the number two lane on the lower screen, he identified it as his vehicle initially. Watch the light up here. It turns green, light in the upper left-hand corner. Traffic starts to proceed north and southbound on Castro Street. We see the first sedan that came up to the intersection. We see Mr. Pollak’s [Honda] Element in the number two lane and we see the second vehicle that had arrived at the intersection proceed.\\r\\n“Your Honor, the evidence in this case demonstrates beyond any doubt that when Mr. Pollak said that he stopped at the intersection as Mr. Bucchere was slightly behind his vehicle, that’s wrong. And when he\\u200a—\\u200athe video showed us\\u200a—\\u200awhen he said that Mr. Bucchere whizzed by his car as he was stopped at the intersection, that’s wrong. The video proves it. When he said that the second bicyclist came down and stopped alongside him at the intersection while he, Mr. Pollak, was parked there or stopped there, that was wrong. The video proves it. And if the Court has any question about that last point, I would like to replay the video at about 8:02:20 again.”\\r\\n“That won’t be necessary,” said Judge Cheng.\\r\\nMy feeling of confidence in Ted\\u200a—\\u200amy feeling that finally he was cutting through the layers to arrive at the heart of the matter\\u200a—\\u200awas profound, but also a bit dampened by the fact that Judge Cheng was acting like he either had seen all of this before or that he just didn’t care. Or maybe it was both.\\r\\n“At 8:02:14\\u200a—\\u200aand if the Court has any question of this, I would like to try to have you replay it or ask to have it plugged into your own computer so that you can look at it yourself. I urge you to do that.”\\r\\nBut the court, represented by the Honorable Judge Cheng, didn’t even dignify Ted’s urging with a response.\\r\\nTed continued: “At 8:02:14, Mr. Bucchere had entered the intersection, the light turned red. Later, three vehicles approached the Market Street intersection southbound on Castro Street. The third vehicle was Mr. Pollak’s Honda Element. He admitted it on the stand before he realized that that happened at 8:02:47 according to the video, which is thirty seconds after the accident,\\r\\nafter the accident\\r\\n. The video proves it, Your Honor. Mr. Pollak was wrong; he was flat wrong.\\r\\n“The video proves that Mr. Bucchere did not run the red. Certainly there’s no reliable evidence in front of this court that he did and I’m asking the Court to make that finding.\\r\\n“The second question addressed by Mr. Mahoney was whether the WALK signal illuminated for east and westbound pedestrians before the accident? I’ll just briefly review the evidence that we know.\\r\\n“8:02:14, the light controlling traffic northbound on Castro Street turns red. We know from the traffic sequence control report that there’s a three and a half second all red. That means that until at least 8:02:17, probably 8:02:17.5 according to Mr. Mahoney, the WALK signal east and westbound on Castro Street did not illuminate.\\r\\n“Now, the witnesses that the Court heard from told a different story and I want to suggest to the Court again this is not an issue of credibility. I’m sure they were doing the best they can and I’m sure they tried to tell the truth as they remember it.\\r\\n“Ms. Woo, who was the prosecution’s first witness\\u200a—\\u200aI’m sorry. Excuse me, thank you. Ms. Yu, Y-U, she testified that she entered the crosswalk when the white hand illuminated. The video absolutely proves otherwise. She entered the crosswalk\\u200a—\\u200afirst of all, she admitted she was actually standing in the crosswalk in the lane in front of the bus on the east side of the street the entire time but that at 8:02:14, the video clearly shows that she begins to proceed into the crosswalk. And I submit to Your Honor that what she and the other pedestrians walking eastbound clearly did is what we see pedestrians in rush hour traffic do all the time, they wait for the cross signal to turn red and they start to proceed across the street. That’s clearly what happened here. The light turned red, she starts to go, other pedestrians follow.\\r\\n“Why don’t we go back to 8:02:08? Are you ready?\\r\\n“Your Honor, I want to briefly play it for you. 8:02:11, they’re in the crosswalk. 8:02:14, she begins to walk aggressively across the street. 8:02:16, she’s almost there and we have the accident.\\r\\n“Conversely, from the other direction on the west side, as Mr. Mahoney admitted when he was watching the video, the pedestrians on the west side commenced into the crosswalk at 8:02:16, a second before the light illuminates for walk.\\r\\n“Angelo Cilia, as the Court may have just observed, he did pretty well. He stays on the sidewalk until 8:02:16 or thereabouts and he’s only taken one or two steps into the crosswalk before 8:02:17, when the light turns white for pedestrians and also at the time of the accident. He\\u200a—\\u200ahis conduct, and I believe his testimony, actually contradicts Ms. Yu and establishes that she started walking into the intersection well before the WALK signal.\\r\\n“So the evidence establishes that Mr. Bucchere did not run the red light, he entered the intersection lawfully, and the evidence shows that the pedestrians entered the crosswalk too soon, and many legal consequences flow from that. And I laid them out a little bit in our memo.\\r\\n“But under the law, because Mr. Bucchere entered lawfully, he had the right of way; the pedestrians did not. The pedestrians were required to yield to traffic in the intersection; they did not. And they were required to wait until the white signal\\u200a—\\u200athe WALK signal\\u200a—\\u200ailluminated and they did not.”\\r\\nThere it was: the very core of our defense strategy.\\r\\n“So 8:02:14, red light, three-and-a-half-second all red, 8:02:17.5, WALK signal.\\r\\n“The third issue that Mr. Mahoney was asked to address, the speed. Mr. Mahoney is the only witness who testified that Mr. Bucchere’s speed exceeded the lawful limit of twenty-five miles per hour. He estimated his speed at thirty-two miles per hour. He did that based on speculation. He did that based on observing the video and trying to guess the distance from the point of impact to where he could see Mr. Bucchere at 8:02:14 on the tape.\\r\\n“Now, I agree that the evidence clearly shows that Mr. Bucchere was within the intersection. You can see it, and the Court can see it when you look at the exhibits, how far, how many feet he was from the impact. Where we have an expert testifying to feet per second down to the thousandths of a foot based on his time-distance calculations; this is not reliable; this is speculative; this is guesswork.\\r\\n“So the prosecution, by failing to fix Mr. Bucchere’s precise location at the time their expert wants to make a time-distance calculation, has failed to establish the predicate for that calculation; Therefore, the speed calculation is not reliable and should not be relied upon by this court, especially when it’s presented by an expert who was so severely wrong in his opinions.\\r\\n“So, Your Honor, I’m asking the Court\\u200a—\\u200aand I know it’s unusual but we have a case in which the evidence that is presented by the prosecution and is irrefutable before the Court establishes that the light turned red at 8:02:14, that Mr. Bucchere was in the intersection at that time, and that the pedestrians walking east-west on Castro Street proceeded into the intersection before the WALK signal illuminated and I’m asking the Court to make those three findings.”\\r\\nWhile Ted’s request hung in the air, the court continued to go about its business as if the request simply did not exist.\\r\\n“Do you wish to address the 17(b) issues now or after Mr. Talai’s response?” Judge Cheng asked.\\r\\n“I would like to after, please,” Ted said.\\r\\nWith that, Ted sat down unceremoniously. The 17(b)\\u200a—\\u200aa motion we brought before the court to ask that my charges be reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor\\u200a—\\u200acould be addressed later. Now it was time to hear what\\u200a—\\u200aif anything\\u200a—\\u200athe prosecution would say about our complete unraveling of their entire case.\\r\\nWhat could they possibly say?\\r\\nI wondered. They were sunk.\\r\\nHere, at the zenith of the preliminary hearing\\u200a—\\u200amy confidence buoyed up by Ted’s powerful summarization\\u200a—\\u200aI felt ready to put this entire affair behind me and reclaim what was left of my routine existence.\\r\\n7 March 2013–343 days since the accident\\r\\nA\\r\\nfter all of his eyewitnesses and his $350/hour expert were flatly contradicted by the video evidence that Omid himself had introduced, I hadn’t the faintest idea what to expect from his closing argument, but I was hoping it wouldn’t fall too far short of an apology for being gravely mistaken in just about every possible way.\\r\\nEven if I didn’t get a formal, on-the-record apology, at the very least, Omid would have to agree that Ted had disproved all of his crucial eyewitness and expert witness testimony, leaving his case in ruins, and leaving Judge Cheng with no alternative but to drop\\u200a—\\u200aor at the very least reduce\\u200a—\\u200amy charges.\\r\\nFirst, Omid asked Judge Cheng, “May I sit since this is a\\r\\npreliminary\\r\\nhearing, Your Honor?” He really drew out the word\\r\\npreliminary\\r\\n. In contrast, Ted had stood at the podium for his closing argument, so by making a statement about sitting down in the “informal spirit” of a PX, Omid basically backhanded Ted across the face.\\r\\n“Yes,” said Judge Cheng, as obliviously as he had acted while conducting all of his operations in court. I still kept wondering if he was checking his email on that giant monitor on his desk.\\r\\n“Thank you,” Omid said. He cast a sidelong glance at Ted that had “gotcha!” written all over it.\\r\\n“I would like to start and I should first say, please don’t let the length of my argument lend any weight towards my feelings on this case. I just don’t need to go quite as long,” said Omid.\\r\\n“I’m going to start by addressing the over thirty-page motion that was filed yesterday by Mr. Cassman. In my only five years of experience, I’ve actually never seen this happen before. And what I mean by that is there’s a sentence in here on the first page that says, ‘We believe that the evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing does not even come close to supporting such a finding.’ The reason why I find that a bit ridiculous is this motion was written before a preliminary hearing happened. And after that is written, Mr. Cassman lays out the facts, and I say in quotation ‘the facts of the preliminary hearing.’ He has given the Court the facts of the preliminary hearing before a preliminary hearing has happened.”\\r\\nAt this point, I stopped listening. I turned my head clockwise, away from Omid\\u200a—\\u200aas far as I could stretch my neck without attracting suspicion\\u200a—\\u200aand I stared at the cheap, ugly wall. I could not believe that this guy was going to ignore the 800-pound-gorilla-sized hole we punched in his case and instead complain that a motion filed the day before was filed too soon.\\r\\nOf course it was written before the preliminary.\\r\\nIn fact, most of the contents of this brief were based on research we had done long, long ago. Ted and Julie presented the research in a similar memo to Omid and the other ADAs working this case\\r\\nsix months ago\\r\\n, along with a dozen letters of support from my friends and family.\\r\\nOmid’s best criticism of our argument was that it was\\u200a—\\u200atoo long? Or filed too soon? Or delivered from a standing position instead of a sitting position?\\r\\nSeriously? Has the world gone mad?\\r\\nNot only was Omid’s attack on our word count and filing date irrelevant, it was also wrong. We filed it while the PX was still in progress?\\r\\nSorry, our bad\\r\\n. We just thought that the PX would have ended yesterday, but the “expert” tried to will a traffic light out of existence, forcing us to find a way to will it back into existence, thereby pushing us into Day Two.\\r\\nThen, suddenly, I had an optimistic thought:\\r\\nIf this is the best Omid can muster, perhaps he’s handed us a tremendous opportunity\\r\\n.\\r\\nPerhaps he knows he’s toast\\r\\n.\\r\\nPerhaps we’ve already won.\\r\\nI had a hard time focusing as Omid rambled on. Out of nowhere, he slung another zinger at Ted.\\r\\n“That obviously causes some problems that I want to go through right now because what he says are facts to you in this motion that he signed and he conveniently handed out to the press yesterday are not facts that were presented in court here yesterday under sworn testimony,” Omid said.\\r\\nI had a rough time parsing that sentence, but I thought I just heard him accuse us of trying to manipulate the media\\u200a—\\u200athat was pretty rich. I kept half listening and half drifting in my thoughts.\\r\\nI hope I’ll get a transcript of this\\r\\n.\\r\\nSomeday I’ll need to sort through it and process it.\\r\\n“Okay? There’s language about what Tobias Hanks said. None of that was presented to the Court yesterday.”\\r\\nTobias\\xa0…\\r\\nwhy is he talking about Tobias\\r\\n? Oh, to say that we\\r\\nhadn’t\\r\\ntalked about Tobias during the PX, except, of course, we had. Inspector Cadigan had contorted Tobias’s statement so that it sounded like we blew red lights as a matter of course.\\r\\n“He goes on to talk about the Honda Element and how thirty seconds after the incident is when you see the Honda Element. Again, the problem with writing the facts before the facts are actually given to the Court is you’re going to give incorrect statements.”\\r\\nWhoa\\r\\n…\\r\\nwait a minute! Is he really going to argue against the timing of Pollak’s arrival at the intersection, after Pollak himself identified his car arriving at the intersection thirty seconds after the accident? This is not happening!\\r\\nSuddenly, my optimistic thoughts collided violently with the reality of the courthouse, sending fierce shivers down my spine. I seized my notepad, threw it open, and scrawled as fast as I could:\\r\\nHE’S USING THE TIMESTAMP ON OUR FILING TO DEBUNK TED’S ARGUMENTS\\u200a—\\u200aCAN HE EVEN DO THAT?\\r\\nI slid the notebook to Julie with more gusto than necessary.\\r\\n“Nathan Pollak was clear,” Omid continued, defending the testimony of a person who had perjured himself just the day before.\\r\\nJulie handed my notebook back to me. “He’s going to have to do better than that,” it said.\\r\\nOmid continued, “People’s Five, if I may approach, shows an intersection and prior to that intersection, there is a white line. The facts,\\r\\nthe actual facts\\r\\nare Nathan Pollak said he stopped at that first white line, Mr. Bucchere then flew by him. Then he was very eager to move forward. He wanted to be helpful. He eased forward after a while and then he stopped at that crosswalk which is shown in the video. That’s the facts as the Court heard them yesterday.”\\r\\nI couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Omid just used the following phrase: “The facts,\\r\\nthe actual facts\\r\\nare Nathan Pollak said he stopped at the first while line, Mr. Bucchere then flew by him.”\\r\\nYet Omid must have known, like we knew, like Judge Cheng\\u200a—\\u200aif he was paying attention at all\\u200a—\\u200aalso knew, that the video clearly showed Pollak’s Honda Element rolling up to the northernmost limit line thirty seconds after the accident. So now Omid was claiming that the words of Nathan Pollak were “the facts,\\r\\nthe actual facts\\r\\n” and that those “actual facts” somehow superseded video evidence to the contrary.\\r\\n“‘8:02:09’\\u200a—\\u200athis is quoting from the motion\\u200a—\\u200a‘at least two pedestrians have already started to cross from the east.’ I know the Court has the video, watched the video. I don’t know what else to say other than that that’s incorrect, that’s false and that’s misleading. When you watch the video, that’s not what’s happening. They are not crossing the street.”\\r\\nI think he’s talking about Wen-chih and Bag Man.\\r\\nAnybody could take one look at the video and see that those two folks were in a mighty big hurry to cross, stepping out more than fourteen seconds ahead of the WALK sign.\\r\\n“‘8:02:14’\\u200a—\\u200aalso, just because it’s written on the board doesn’t make it a fact.” Omid shook a finger at Ted, Julie, and me, all in turn. Then he spun around and shook another finger at the easel. “If that light is controlling that intersection, 8:02:13 is when it turns red. It’s still red at 8:02:14 but it’s not just turning red at 8:02:14. This is, I guess, more of an opinion by Mr. Cassman.”\\r\\nWhoa, slow down for a minute.\\r\\nWe had used a traffic light to prove that their timeline was off by 100%, and Omid had said, “This is, I guess, more of an opinion by Mr. Cassman.”\\r\\nOmid’s own expert claimed, under sworn testimony, that my light turned red at 8:02:10.5, assuming the pedestrians starting walking only when they got the WALK symbol. But now, the ADA had thrown out everything his expert had presented and now wanted to work with a third set of numbers and argue whether the light turned red at 8:02:13 or 8:02:14.\\r\\nDuring the hearing, we had only used the wall clock (shown in the video)\\u200a—\\u200ainstead of frame numbers\\u200a—\\u200abecause we figured that the DA and his team didn’t know how to break the video into frames\\u200a—\\u200athereby making all of our time-based calculations (e.g. speed) 6.2 times more accurate. We knew the light turned red on frame #4431 and yes, Omid now wanted the light to turn red when the wall clock read 8:02:13. And it does\\u200a—\\u200abut only for two frames, at which point it flips to 8:02:14. So considering the starting frame and the frame rate (6.2 f/s), the light turned red approximately when the wall clock would have shown 8:02:13.6 (if it had shown tenths of a second, which it did not).\\r\\n“The pedestrian created obstacles to traffic,” Omid continued. “I guess pedestrians crossing the street are obstacles. The bicycle, I will explain in a second, was speeding.\\r\\n“The government’s expert evidence testified that Strava data showed that Mr. Bucchere was going approximately thirty-two miles per hour. I don’t even think I said the word Strava yesterday, so to write in this motion that I am relying on Strava to show that the Defendant was speeding is again false, misleading and inaccurate.”\\r\\nWith that proclamation, Omid debunked blogger James Herd’s entire Strava-made-me-do-it conspiracy theory on sfcitizen.com.\\r\\nI really hope some reporter wrote THAT down\\r\\n, I thought.\\r\\n“Having covered what are not facts, I would like to actually talk about what was talked about yesterday in court. To go through that, I know the Court is familiar with the law but I’m reading straight from CALCRIM.”\\r\\nOmid then proceeded\\r\\nnot\\r\\nto read from CALCRIM, the California Criminal Jury Instructions.\\r\\n“I need to show there’s gross negligence. A person acts with gross negligence when the way he acts is so different from how an ordinarily careful person would act in the same situation. I submit to the Court that an ordinarily careful person does not run a light at 14th Street, does not run a light at 15th Street, does not run a stop sign at 16th Street, and does not then run a light at Castro and Market. I would submit to the Court that an ordinarily careful person does not do those things while speeding.”\\r\\nOmid leaned precariously on Pollak’s testimony while paying no attention to the fact that we had refuted every last word based on the time he arrived at the intersection. We also had GPX waypoints from my iPhone showing that I stopped at 14th Street for the red and then carried my speed through 15th Street, indicating that it was likely green, but we were keeping those in our back pocket for the time being, just in case the DA still believed in Pollak’s lies, which seemed to be the case, at least at this juncture.\\r\\n“I would submit to the Court that an ordinarily careful person does not run those three stop lights, that one stop sign, and speed, and fail to yield. To go over the speed, Mr. Cassman said moments ago, ‘Mr. Mahoney is the only person that testified to speed.’ That’s not in the motion, that was said here in court a few minutes ago. Mr. Mahoney is the only person who testified to speed. We can’t just say things to the Court and hope that you take that as fact. Mr. Mahoney is not the only person that said that. Nathan Pollak actually articulated that he was going about thirty on his bike, saw it on his speedometer when the Defendant then whizzed by him, so it’s false to say Mr. Mahoney was the only person.”\\r\\nYes, but the video proves that Nathan Pollak didn’t pace me down the hill; he rolled up thirty seconds later. Why are you relying on testimony we already disproved?\\r\\nI wanted to scream.\\r\\n“With respect to the video and the stoplight, nobody has come into this court and articulated where the bicycle was at that time, not one person has said that. So even if the light did control that, which the only expert who’s testified did not say that, there’s no evidence that the Defendant flew by at that time.”\\r\\nHe’s gonna bank on Mahoney? Really?\\r\\n“What Mr. Cassman’s essentially saying is all seven or so people in the intersection, all of them, each and every single one of them, violated the law and the Defendant was actually obeying the law and Mr. Pollak flat-out lied.”\\r\\nYES, that’s exactly what we’re saying. Can we go home now?\\r\\n“[Mr. Cassman] didn’t mince his words. He said the other witnesses were actually maybe mistaken, but Mr. Pollak, who ironically not only happens to be a bicyclist himself but bicycled to court yesterday, explained what he saw.”\\r\\nEach time Omid referred to Pollak as a cyclist, it drove me a little more crazy\\u200a—\\u200aas if this fact somehow made his lies more believable. Or did Omid think it was clever to set up another cyclist to take down one of his own? It was all just so obvious and distasteful.\\r\\n“I feel the need to kind of defend Mr. Pollak’s testimony,” the ADA continued. “He is somehow a bad citizen or San Franciscan because what he wanted to do was help, sends himself a message the day or very soon after the incident to be able to explain exactly what happened. Through Mr. Cassman’s questioning, he’s somehow interested in what the media has to say about him. That could not be further from the truth.”\\r\\nOf course, no one had any idea what Pollak’s true motivations were\\u200a—\\u200aboth sides were guilty of conjecture on that topic. Besides, only one thing mattered:\\r\\nThe video refuted his entire testimony.\\r\\n“He came in here as a cyclist himself who said conservatively he cycled in the city over 1,000 times and simply explained what happened. And the ironic thing about the entire, ‘did he run the red light, did he not run the red light’? The evidence and the facts as they came out in my opinion are that he ran the red light.\\r\\nWhat\\r\\n?\\r\\n“Even if you want to believe he didn’t [run the red light], which I’m saying is not the case, but even if you want to believe he didn’t, when you’re speeding and you fail to yield, those are two infractions in the complaint which are enough to hold the Defendant to answer. Okay?”\\r\\nOkay! But if I didn’t run the red light, and the pedestrians didn’t wait for the WALK symbol, then I had the right of way. Under those circumstances, as awful as it sounds, they were required by law to yield to me\\u200a—\\u200aso I cannot be charged with failure to yield to them.\\r\\n“And to say that it is guesswork on the part of Mr. Mahoney, who obviously knows more than, I think, than all of us given his background, training and experience, is a stretch at best. Over 1,500 investigations, many times for the defense. I know you’re very familiar with his background, training, and experience because you were here yesterday and you actually heard the facts that were stated.”\\r\\nWell-certified and qualified, yet he didn’t see the traffic light staring at him right in the face.\\r\\n“For all those reasons, I think it’s very clear the Defendant was not ordinarily careful as the same person would be in a similarly situated position. Ordinary people do not run two stoplights, one stop sign, speed, then run another stoplight.\\r\\n“And what every single witness was very consistent about. Castro and Market Street is not the Financial District. Castro and Market Street at 8:00 a.m. on a weekday is the height of rush hour traffic with MUNI there, numerous buses, numerous pedestrians, numerous cars.\\r\\n“For all those reasons, I think there is at the very least a strong suspicion that the Defendant should be held on the one count that he’s charged with.\\r\\n“Submit.”\\r\\nFinally and abruptly, Omid’s closing argument came to a conclusion. I still grasped for ways to understand his claims and his vitriol directed at Ted and me.\\r\\n“Mr. Cassman,” said Judge Cheng, “given that we’ve been at this nearly an hour, I want to give you a chance to make the 17(b) and present the 17(b) argument and then give you a chance to respond substantively on the merits. Why don’t you make [the] argument first.”\\r\\n“Yes, Your Honor,” Ted said. “Thank you.\\r\\n“I’ll be very brief. We submitted the memorandum yesterday. Obviously it had been prepared before the preliminary examination so I tried to anticipate what the evidence would show based upon in part an expert’s report, and then the expert came in [and] did not rely on the very data that he presented in his report to me.\\r\\n“With regard [to] the letters that were attached to the memorandum, which are the bulk of the memorandum that counsel referred to thirty pages, I’m not sure it’s that long but both of them are letters that counsel’s had for many, many months so there’s nothing new there.\\r\\n“The letters of support demonstrate what is obviously true in this case: That Mr. Bucchere is a man of great character, a man of great substance, a man of great potential, a family man, a man committed to his community, a man who has demonstrated that he’s committed to bicycle safety. He was on the bicycle team at Stanford, he does bicycle safety training for people, he does regular riding. He has ridden in his lifetime over 30,000 miles. He has never been in an accident, he has never hurt anybody, he’s never seriously been implicated in any event involving a bicycle or a motor vehicle for that matter.\\r\\n“His driving record is clean, his criminal history is clean. He is a man who gives back to his society, who knows how fortunate he is, who cares for his community, and for his neighbors and for his family.\\r\\n“In this matter, the factors the Court is to consider pursuant to Penal Code 17(b) militate very strongly in favor of a reduction to a misdemeanor should the Court find that there’s a basis for a finding that the offense was committed.”\\r\\n“Mr. Talai, the 17(b) issue,” said Judge Cheng.\\r\\n“Sure,” Omid said. “Given that Mr. Cassman, obviously, which is within his right, relied on some hearsay regarding Mr. Bucchere, it’s also within my right to do the same thing. I don’t personally know the Defendant but I do know that the day of this incident, he submitted a blog and that blog I think is very telling of his character.”\\r\\nHere we go,\\r\\nI thought\\r\\n.\\r\\nOmid was about to quote my personal email that the media had turned into a public blog post.\\r\\nI’m sure he’ll only read the section about helmet safety, and I’m sure he’ll construe it to mean something it doesn’t.\\r\\nTed tried to stop this dead in its tracks.\\r\\n“Is the blog before the Court?” he interjected forcefully.\\r\\n“It is not before the Court,” said Judge Cheng, not making any attempt to stop Omid from slandering me with my own words.\\r\\nOmid continued: “And within that blog, he says, ‘In closing, I want to dedicate this story to my late helmet.’ He does not want to dedicate this story to the man whose skull he fractured, the man whose brain he forced to hemorrhage. He is not dedicating this story to the man that he killed.”\\r\\nRight there, again, he had conjured up the spurious comparison between my helmet and the man I “killed,” a comparison I never made and never would\\u200a—\\r\\nbecause it’s\\r\\npreposterous and insane.\\r\\nAlso, nobody had died when I wrote that email, but that never seemed to matter to anyone but me.\\r\\n“This is a form of a homicide. And it’s not a murder, it’s not as serious as a murder, that’s why it’s not filed as a murder. He was extremely reckless. The fact that he is an experienced cyclist, I find more worrisome. The fact that he is familiar with that intersection is more worrisome, that he knows how busy it is at 8:00 a.m., that he is supposedly so experienced having been on the Stanford’s riding team. When you are going above the speed limit\\u200a—\\u200a”\\r\\n“Excuse me, Your Honor,” Ted interrupted Omid to ask for some tissues because I had started to weep uncontrollably.\\r\\nWhy did I start crying? I’m not sure. Perhaps because the DA and the media had created a public persona for me that was defined by only two events: a bike accident and a poorly-timed, wildly-misinterpreted email I wrote while in shock, on drugs, and suffering from a concussion.\\r\\nBut that isn’t who I am\\u200a—\\u200amy life is about so much more.\\r\\nFurthermore, this was the first time since the accident that anyone had publicly spoken about the parts of my life\\r\\nnot\\r\\nrelated to this accident and put them on display for the world to see. But rather than acknowledge anything Ted had said about the case or about me and my character, Omid pulled one line from an email that neither he\\u200a—\\u200anor anyone but the intended recipients\\u200a—\\u200ahad any business reading, let alone misinterpreting to mean that I valued a helmet’s “death” more than the death of a person who hadn’t yet died. No one could possibly know how I felt about the death of Sutchi Hui. No one ever will.\\r\\nI was stuck between time and space, no longer able to comprehend the reality unfolding around me and all I could do was weep. So I wept. And wept. Finally, as my weeping turned into sobbing, Omid continued with his character assassination.\\r\\n“If the Court looks at one of these pictures where there’s about five people or so within the intersection and what the Defendant did, according to Mr. Nathan Pollak, is barrel down in order to speed up. An experienced rider who was conservatively thirty, forty or probably more feet away from all these pedestrians would be experienced enough that he would try to avoid the collision as opposed to barrel down and speed up.”\\r\\nAgain, Omid assumed that I somehow could have avoided this accident, that I recklessly, selfishly, and heartlessly chose not to. That simply was the opposite of what actually happened, and I’m sure Omid knew it. But at this point, he served only one purpose: to deliver to his boss a conviction of this “reckless cycling monster” that Gascón had created by feeding false information to the press.\\r\\n“I cannot speak further on his character other than the blog, which I think is more telling than a year after the incident having hired a team of attorneys and gathered a series of letters. I think how you act soon after the incident is far more telling than what you’re doing a year later when you’re charged with a felony.\\r\\n“I can say that there are family members of the victim here as far as Taiwan. From what I know about the man that the Defendant killed on March 29th of last year, he was a very important man. He was a husband, he was a grandfather, he was a father, he was an uncle. And while he was seventy-one, which I’ve heard people say, he was a very healthy and happy seventy-one who family members told me yesterday we still needed him. It’s not that we wanted him, we all still needed him here. For all those reasons, I feel the Court should not reduce this to a misdemeanor.”\\r\\n“Mr. Cassman, I’m going to give you the last word on either the 17(b) issue or the substantives,” said Judge Cheng.\\r\\n“Thank you, Your Honor.\\r\\n“Showing you Defense Exhibit C, Your Honor, the limit line that Mr. Pollak was referring to that he finally stopped at 8:02:47, which is clearly shown on the videotape, is this line here north of the crosswalk, on the north side of Market Street. To suggest that what that video shows is his car stopping at the limit line sometime before the accident, which occurred at 8:02:17, and then creeping forward a few feet towards that line is\\r\\npatently absurd\\r\\nand\\r\\nwrong\\r\\nand\\r\\nmisleading\\r\\nand\\r\\nit cannot be countenanced\\r\\n.”\\r\\nTed couldn’t have possibly chosen firmer language than “patently absurd.” His tone didn’t show how irate he must have felt, but he spoke sternly and forcefully.\\r\\n“That’s just\\r\\nwrong\\r\\n,” he said. “That’s not the evidence before the Court and the prosecution shouldn’t be making such arguments to the Court.”\\r\\nBut they had. And if given the chance, I suspected they would do it again.\\r\\n“Anything else on the 17(b) argument?” Judge Cheng asked, using the same tone most road-tripping kids use when they ask, “Are we there yet?”\\r\\n“Okay,” said Ted, not letting the judge end the hearing before he again reiterated how Pollak had fabricated his entire testimony. “I was just going to say Mr. Pollak’s testimony is flatly proven to be false and wrong. I didn’t call him a liar but he’s wrong.\\r\\n“And I’ll move to [the] 17(b),” Ted continued. “I want to say this. After this accident, and Inspector Cadigan is here so she knows this to be true, Mr. Bucchere called her about Mr. Hui’s condition every day and inquired. He went to the hospital and brought a card and flowers. He was concerned about Mr. Hui because he is a good man who cares and who knows that life is precious and that we all have to treasure. That blog is total hearsay and it’s not before the Court. What is before the Court are the many letters from very important and prestigious people supporting Mr. Bucchere and demonstrating his good character.”\\r\\n“Okay. Submitted from both sides?” asked the judge.\\r\\n“Yes. Thank you, Your Honor,” said Omid.\\r\\n“Mr. Cassman, submitted?”\\r\\n“Yes, Your Honor.”\\r\\nSo just like that, the lying and the perjuring and the name-calling and the objecting and the fighting and the weeping ceased. I breathed in slowly and awaited the words of the Honorable Judge Cheng. I feared the worst, but I tried to center my thoughts on the best outcome: a dropping of the charges\\u200a—\\u200aor at least a reduction to a misdemeanor.\\r\\nFor surely the judge would see the light shining through the tattered remains of the DA’s case.\\r\\nOr would he?\\r\\n7 March 2013–343 days since the accident\\r\\nB\\r\\nefore I could even finish exhaling, Judge Cheng had already launched into his decision. He spoke quietly, dispassionately. He looked in our general direction, but avoided eye contact with me, despite the fact that I was staring directly at him.\\r\\n“The Court finds from the production of satisfactory evidence to show the following felony has been committed,” he said.\\r\\n“Count One alleged in the Complaint, a violation of 192(c)(1) of the Penal Code. He’s held to answer.”\\r\\nThe words came out of the judge’s mouth in such a matter-of-fact manner that I had to wonder if he hadn’t made up his mind weeks ago and just let the lawyers duke it out for the past day and a half so he could have time to play Solitaire or check email on his computer. The nonchalance with which he processed all the testimony and the evidence, especially the video\\u200a—\\u200a“\\r\\nWould you like to see that again, Your Honor?” “No that won’t be necessary.”\\u200a—\\r\\nmade me suspect that he had made up his mind well before we ever got here.\\r\\n“The Court has taken into account the fact that Mr. Bucchere has no criminal record, has a family of his own, and has an overall record of being a very productive and contributing member of society. As such, the Court denies without prejudice the 17(b) motion.”\\r\\nThis part, too, I failed to understand. Why did my stature in the community have anything to do with the 17(b) motion, and, moreover, if my prior positive contributions to society did bear relevance, why was he denying our motion in the first place? I sat at the defense table, mouth agape, staring at the judge, who continued to avoid eye contact.\\r\\n“It’s the hope of the Court that the parties will reach a resolution prior to trial that recognizes the severity of the conduct that occurred but also recognizes the enormous potential Mr. Bucchere has to make amends for it. I’m certain that Mr. Bucchere is going to carry this mistake for the rest of his life, so will the family and loved ones of Sutchi Hui.\\r\\n“Mr. Bucchere, you’re ordered to appear in Department 22 for instruction and arraignment on March 21st, 9:00 a.m. Bail will remain as previously set.”\\r\\nWith that, Judge Cheng rapped his gavel and the matter was adjourned. As the courtroom emptied, I sat there completely shell-shocked, sweat bleeding through into my jacket, and my face crusted from salty tears. I had no idea what had just happened to me\\u200a—\\u200aand worse\\u200a—\\u200aI had no idea why.\\r\\nWe held all the cards. Ted’s closing argument tied it all together. Did any of that actually happen? Or did I imagine it?\\r\\nAt last, with the courtroom nearly empty, I turned to face Ted, just then noticing that his hand was on my back. I didn’t know how long it had been there, but I appreciated the gesture. My eyes welling up with tears, I managed to eke out a few words.\\r\\n“What happened?”\\r\\n“Nothing we didn’t already see coming. I know you want to know, but we can’t talk about it here.”\\r\\nTed was right. There were reporters everywhere and probably half a dozen TV crews with cameras and microphones waiting outside.\\r\\n“All right,” I said, “let’s get out of here. Let’s split up and meet at Roma. You guys scatter and leave in different directions; I’ll head straight for the stairs\\u200a—\\u200athe news crews won’t know who to follow.”\\r\\n“I don’t think this will work. All they want is you,” said Julie.\\r\\n“Does anyone have a better plan?”\\r\\nTed, Fred, and Julie looked at one another and then back at me.\\r\\n“Well, alrighty then, let’s go.” I was determined the get the fuck out of that incomprehensibly miserable place.\\r\\nFred grabbed the easel, and Julie and Ted each picked up a massive bag of documents and all manners of electronic equipment. The four of us walked down the aisle in the middle of the gallery\\u200a—\\u200aTed first, then Julie, then Fred, then me, bringing up the rear. The courtroom\\u200a—\\u200ahaving been the scene of a knock-down, drag-out battle just minutes ago\\u200a—\\u200anow sat nearly empty and nearly silent. As Ted reached the vestibule, we could hear the din outside. Ted turned his head to face the three of us.\\r\\n“Ready?” he asked.\\r\\nI nodded with trepidation, and he gently pushed the door open, revealing absolute pandemonium.\\r\\n“Mr. Cassman! Mr. Cassman! Mr. Cassman!” came shouts from three different directions. I’m sure the reporters asked questions, but I didn’t hear them. I only heard the shouting of Ted’s name as he broke off to the right and some of the news crews swarmed around him. I felt like I had a chance to escape. I cut past Julie and Fred and swung out to the left, hoping that Ted would continue to divert attention from me.\\r\\n“Mr. Bucchere! Mr. Bucchere! Mr. Bucchere!” I heard from all around me as I darted toward the stairs. Reporters shoved cameras and microphones in my face, shouting all types of words at me that I did not hear, let alone comprehend. I just needed to make it to the stairs.\\r\\nIn my confusion and haste, the location of the stairwell I had used at least a dozen times before evaded me.\\r\\nWhere are those goddamn stairs?\\r\\nI turned down a large hallway, feeling the stampede of reporters hot at my heels. Then I saw something else that could facilitate my escape.\\r\\nElevators! Yes, elevators!\\r\\nI pressed the down button as the entire throng of reporters and their camera crews crowded into the elevator lobby, surrounding me. More questions, more microphones and cameras shoved in my face, but no elevator. I stood facing the door of one of the four elevators, inviting the cameras to film the back of my head, and responding to no one, yet keeping my eyes up.\\r\\nI counted to three. Then five. Then ten. No elevators. And with the way the reporters had me cornered, I could only access the one elevator right in front of me, not the others. It finally dawned on me that this elevator plan would never work, so I turned on my heels and walked directly through the horde, which gave way as I stormed through. Coming out of the elevator lobby, I made two lefts, desperately seeking the elusive stairwell. Instead, I found myself headed for a dead end. This time, the reporters didn’t follow. Ted and Fred caught up with me. We had put at least twenty yards between us and the gaggle of reporters.\\r\\n“Chris! Calm down! You can’t let them see you like this,” Ted’s words were stern and direct.\\r\\n“Like what?” I demanded, even though I already knew the answer.\\r\\n“Rattled. Distraught. Walking way too fast! We never should have split up.”\\r\\n“You’re right. Julie was right.” I felt like a fool for suggesting it.\\r\\n“What now?”\\r\\n“Fred and I are going to walk you directly to the stairwell, straight through the mob of reporters who are blocking the way.”\\r\\n“\\r\\nThat’s\\r\\nwhy I couldn’t find the stairwell.”\\r\\n“Doesn’t matter,” said Ted. “Just listen to me. Fred and I will walk in front of you, slowly, deliberately, eyes up. We’ll get the reporters out of your way and lead you down the stairwell. Don’t respond to anyone, don’t look at anyone, don’t say ‘no comment’, and most importantly, don’t\\r\\ntouch\\r\\nanyone. Some cameraman might pull an NBA move and blame you for fouling him, and then you’ll be in a lot more trouble than you’re in now.”\\r\\n“\\r\\nJesus\\r\\n,” I said. “You’re telling me this could actually get\\r\\nworse\\r\\n?” I hadn’t realized how precious little control I had over my fate under these circumstances.\\r\\nSo it came to pass that I made my third attempt of the day to leave the Hall of Justice, this time as more of a passenger on a train being engineered by Ted and Fred\\u200a—\\u200aand thankfully not by me. It felt painfully slow and absolutely wretched to allow the media to shove their implements in my face and ask me questions\\u200a—\\u200aall the while hoping I would slip up and give just one little shove, one little push that would mean I wouldn’t see my daughter grow up.\\r\\nWith the stairwell, in fact, located exactly where it was before\\u200a—\\u200abut on the ass end of the gaggle of reporters\\u200a—\\u200awe finally made it out of the Hall of Justice. Arriving at Cafe Roma, we reunited with Julie. After a few deep breaths, I turned to Ted and asked him to please explain to me what had just happened.\\r\\n“The judge held you to answer. Like I mentioned yesterday, he gave me a lot of clues that his mind was already made up, despite the evidence.”\\r\\n“How could he do that?”\\r\\n“As I’ve told you before, the standard for the PX is very low. The DA just has to show the judge some suspicion of a crime being committed. One witness says you ran one red light and the pedestrians had a WALK symbol\\u200a—\\u200athat’s all he needed to hear. The silver lining here is that we finally got to put our case out there. It’s part of the court record. It’s part of the media record. Hopefully we can start to turn this ship around. This is just the beginning.”\\r\\n“And what about the 17(b)? I thought we had a shot at getting a reduction from felony to misdemeanor?”\\r\\n“We did, but the judge didn’t go for it. It was a long shot anyway.”\\r\\n“And what about this ‘without prejudice’ business. What does that even mean?”\\r\\n“That’s where Judge Cheng really screwed us. ‘Without prejudice’ means that we can’t ask for a reduction from felony to misdemeanor again until sentencing.”\\r\\n“So now it’s plea bargain or trial, and unless the DA agrees to reduce the charges himself, I’ll be leaving my fate in the hands of another judge who could be just as prejudiced as this one.”\\r\\n“Well, be careful with that word ‘prejudiced’\\u200a—\\u200ait means very specific things in the legal world. But otherwise, basically, you’re right.”\\r\\n“So let me get this straight: We debunked all their eyewitnesses and the expert with their own video evidence, and yet they still won and now we’re much worse off than before.”\\r\\n“Yes, they won this battle. But in a way, we won too. We finally got our story out there, based on the only correct interpretation of the video. We’ll live to fight another day. And it’s going to be much harder for them to win in the end now that our story is finally out there.”\\r\\n“And what about that closing argument from Omid? He spent most of his speech on technicalities, repeating debunked testimony, and otherwise diverting attention away from the facts of the case by making wild ad hominem attacks against me.”\\r\\n“And\\r\\nme\\r\\n!” said Ted. “That was deplorable. It was some of the sloppiest, dirtiest work I’ve ever seen from a prosecutor. He should be ashamed of himself. He really showed his true colors. But it doesn’t matter. We’re done with Omid. We need to take this straight to the man behind the curtain to get a resolution.”\\r\\n“Gascón?”\\r\\n“\\r\\nGascón\\r\\n.”\\r\\nTo be continued on October 7, 2018.\\r\\nFor a closer look at the research behind\\r\\nBikelash\\r\\n, visit the\\r\\ncompanion GitHub project\\r\\n.',\n",

       "  'body': 'W jaki sposób marka odzieżowa może ułatwić codzienność niepełnosprawnych dzieci? Na przykład, tak jak Marks & Spencer, stworzyć dla nich kolekcję ubrań, w których będą mogły wygodnie odkrywać świat\\u200a—\\u200atylko tyle i aż tyle. Naszym zdaniem to pomysł genialny w swojej prostocie.\\r\\nUbrania z linii Easy Dressing są łatwe w zakładaniu, wykonane z miękkich materiałów, posiadają minimalną liczbą szwów oraz metki wszyte w taki sposób, by nie stanowiły problemu dla delikatnej skóry. Część z nich wyposażono też w ukryte kieszonki na sondę do karmienia. W kampanii promującej kolekcję wystąpiły m. in. dzieci z zespołem Downa czy poruszające się na wózku. Mali modele zarażają zresztą optymizmem, patrząc z uśmiechem w obiektyw.\\r\\nKolekcja jest kolorowa i na pierwszy rzut oka nie różni się w żaden sposób od zwykłych linii dziecięcych ubrań. I takie też powinno być dzieciństwo niepełnosprawnych dzieci\\u200a—\\u200apełne kolorów i po prostu normalne, mimo przeciwności losu.\\r\\nZapisz się do naszego newslettera i bądź na bieżąco!\\r\\nhttps://www.getrevue.co/profile/Jedno_org\\r\\n—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\u200a—\\r\\nJesteśmy jedno.org.
